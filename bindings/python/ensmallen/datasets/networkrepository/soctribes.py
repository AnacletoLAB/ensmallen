    The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository.	

    Parameters
    -------------------
    directed: bool = False,
        Wether to load the graph as directed or undirected.
        By default false.
    preprocess: bool = True,
        Whether to preprocess the graph to be loaded in 
        optimal time and memory.
    verbose: int = 2,
        Wether to show loading bars during the retrieval and building
        of the graph.
    cache: bool = True,
        Whether to use cache, i.e. download files only once
        and preprocess them only once.
    cache_path: str = "graphs",
        Where to store the downloaded graphs.
    version: str = "latest",
        The version of the graph to retrieve.	
    additional_graph_kwargs: Dict,
        Additional graph kwargs.

    Returns
    -----------------------
    Instace of soc-tribes graph.
