"""
This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph PubMedDiabetes.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the LINQS repository. 
The Pubmed Diabetes dataset consists of 19717 scientific publications from
PubMed database pertaining to diabetes classified into one of three classes.
The citation network consists of 44338 links. Each publication in the dataset
is described by a TF/IDF weighted word vector from a dictionary which consists
of 500 unique words.

    Parameters
    -------------------
    directed: bool = False
        Wether to load the graph as directed or undirected.
        By default false.
    preprocess: bool = True
        Whether to preprocess the graph to be loaded in 
        optimal time and memory.
    verbose: int = 2
        Wether to show loading bars during the retrieval and building
        of the graph.
    cache: bool = True
        Whether to use cache, i.e. download files only once
        and preprocess them only once.
    cache_path: str = "graphs"
        Where to store the downloaded graphs.
    version: str = "latest"
        The version of the graph to retrieve.	
    additional_graph_kwargs: Dict
        Additional graph kwargs.

    Returns
    -----------------------
