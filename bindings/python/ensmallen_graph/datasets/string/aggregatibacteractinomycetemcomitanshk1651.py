This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans HK1651.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 20:16:15.398876

The undirected graph Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans HK1651 has 2241
nodes and 111553 weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph
is dense as it has a density of 0.04444 and has 9 connected components,
where the component with most nodes has 2222 nodes and the component with
the least nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 75, the mean
node degree is 99.56, and the node degree mode is 3. The top 5 most central
nodes are 272556.CF65_00531 (degree 838), 272556.CF65_01913 (degree 658),
272556.CF65_00717 (degree 631), 272556.CF65_00629 (degree 610) and 272556.CF65_02108
(degree 602).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import AggregatibacterActinomycetemcomitansHk1651

    # Then load the graph
    graph = AggregatibacterActinomycetemcomitansHk1651()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
