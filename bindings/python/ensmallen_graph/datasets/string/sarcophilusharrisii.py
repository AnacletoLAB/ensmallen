This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Sarcophilus harrisii.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 

Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 17:32:10.582635

The undirected graph Sarcophilus harrisii has 17721 nodes and 3591783 weighted
edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it has a density
of 0.02288 and is connected, as it has a single component. The graph median
node degree is 281, the mean node degree is 405.37, and the node degree
mode is 236. The top 5 most central nodes are 9305.ENSSHAP00000001747 (degree
4080), 9305.ENSSHAP00000012745 (degree 3445), 9305.ENSSHAP00000019620 (degree
3385), 9305.ENSSHAP00000008915 (degree 3376) and 9305.ENSSHAP00000017285
(degree 3316).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import SarcophilusHarrisii

    # Then load the graph
    graph = SarcophilusHarrisii()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
