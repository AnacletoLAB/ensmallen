This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Aerococcus viridans ATCC11563.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 21:26:30.965723

The undirected graph Aerococcus viridans ATCC11563 has 1916 nodes and 156198
weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it
has a density of 0.08514 and has 7 connected components, where the component
with most nodes has 1898 nodes and the component with the least nodes has
2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 143, the mean node degree is 163.05,
and the node degree mode is 2. The top 5 most central nodes are 655812.HMPREF0061_0624
(degree 951), 655812.HMPREF0061_1667 (degree 761), 655812.HMPREF0061_1347
(degree 729), 655812.HMPREF0061_1271 (degree 711) and 655812.HMPREF0061_0975
(degree 710).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import AerococcusViridansAtcc11563

    # Then load the graph
    graph = AerococcusViridansAtcc11563()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
