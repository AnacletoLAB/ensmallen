This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Sphingomonas sp. PR090111T3T6A.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 21:31:06.711374

The undirected graph Sphingomonas sp. PR090111T3T6A has 3569 nodes and
379881 weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense
as it has a density of 0.05966 and has 9 connected components, where the
component with most nodes has 3552 nodes and the component with the least
nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 170, the mean node degree
is 212.88, and the node degree mode is 2. The top 5 most central nodes
are 685778.AORL01000022_gene1655 (degree 1642), 685778.AORL01000010_gene2673
(degree 1467), 685778.AORL01000021_gene1283 (degree 1344), 685778.AORL01000021_gene764
(degree 1229) and 685778.AORL01000004_gene3557 (degree 1209).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import SphingomonasSpPr090111t3t6a

    # Then load the graph
    graph = SphingomonasSpPr090111t3t6a()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
