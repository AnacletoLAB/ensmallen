This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Campylobacter jejuni 81176.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 20:33:29.200099

The undirected graph Campylobacter jejuni 81176 has 1702 nodes and 115904
weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it
has a density of 0.08007 and has 2 connected components, where the component
with most nodes has 1692 nodes and the component with the least nodes has
10 nodes. The graph median node degree is 115, the mean node degree is
136.20, and the node degree mode is 9. The top 5 most central nodes are
354242.CJJ81176_0955 (degree 726), 354242.CJJ81176_0360 (degree 721), 354242.CJJ81176_1078
(degree 669), 354242.CJJ81176_1469 (degree 656) and 354242.CJJ81176_1264
(degree 602).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import CampylobacterJejuni81176

    # Then load the graph
    graph = CampylobacterJejuni81176()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
