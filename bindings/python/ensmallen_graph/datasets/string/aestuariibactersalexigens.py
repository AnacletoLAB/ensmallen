This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Aestuariibacter salexigens.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 22:30:21.155379

The undirected graph Aestuariibacter salexigens has 3330 nodes and 381865
weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it
has a density of 0.06889 and has 10 connected components, where the component
with most nodes has 3310 nodes and the component with the least nodes has
2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 213, the mean node degree is 229.35,
and the node degree mode is 3. The top 5 most central nodes are 1120953.AUBH01000002_gene1453
(degree 1528), 1120953.AUBH01000005_gene2212 (degree 1298), 1120953.AUBH01000004_gene3074
(degree 1118), 1120953.AUBH01000017_gene2892 (degree 1073) and 1120953.AUBH01000017_gene2891
(degree 1060).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import AestuariibacterSalexigens

    # Then load the graph
    graph = AestuariibacterSalexigens()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
