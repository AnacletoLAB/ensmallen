This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae 1 4074.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 20:07:10.417713

The undirected graph Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae 1 4074 has 2150 nodes
and 193429 weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense
as it has a density of 0.08373 and has 2 connected components, where the
component with most nodes has 2148 nodes and the component with the least
nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 168, the mean node degree
is 179.93, and the node degree mode is 10. The top 5 most central nodes
are 228399.appser1_5170 (degree 902), 228399.appser1_10490 (degree 835),
228399.appser1_6590 (degree 751), 228399.appser1_6580 (degree 720) and
228399.appser1_3860 (degree 714).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import ActinobacillusPleuropneumoniae14074

    # Then load the graph
    graph = ActinobacillusPleuropneumoniae14074()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
