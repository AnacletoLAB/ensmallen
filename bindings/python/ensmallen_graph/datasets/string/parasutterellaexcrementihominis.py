This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Parasutterella excrementihominis.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 21:42:39.612933

The undirected graph Parasutterella excrementihominis has 2704 nodes and
223877 weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense
as it has a density of 0.06126 and has 20 connected components, where the
component with most nodes has 2642 nodes and the component with the least
nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 152, the mean node degree
is 165.59, and the node degree mode is 3. The top 5 most central nodes
are 762966.HMPREF9439_01864 (degree 806), 762966.HMPREF9439_02104 (degree
796), 762966.HMPREF9439_00050 (degree 762), 762966.HMPREF9439_02483 (degree
724) and 762966.HMPREF9439_00594 (degree 722).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import ParasutterellaExcrementihominis

    # Then load the graph
    graph = ParasutterellaExcrementihominis()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
