This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Gammaproteobacteria bacterium MOLA455.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-03 22:44:39.958830

The undirected graph Gammaproteobacteria bacterium MOLA455 has 2324 nodes
and 189709 weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense
as it has a density of 0.07028 and has 2 connected components, where the
component with most nodes has 2318 nodes and the component with the least
nodes has 6 nodes. The graph median node degree is 135, the mean node degree
is 163.26, and the node degree mode is 10. The top 5 most central nodes
are 1411685.U062_01385 (degree 883), 1411685.U062_00261 (degree 879), 1411685.U062_01877
(degree 808), 1411685.U062_00049 (degree 804) and 1411685.U062_00947 (degree
773).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import GammaproteobacteriaBacteriumMola455

    # Then load the graph
    graph = GammaproteobacteriaBacteriumMola455()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
