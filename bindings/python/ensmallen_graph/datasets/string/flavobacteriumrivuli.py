This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Flavobacterium rivuli.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 

Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 22:38:13.906296

The undirected graph Flavobacterium rivuli has 3647 nodes and 258100 weighted edges,
of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it has a density of 0.03882 and
has 18 connected components, where the component with most nodes has 3586 nodes and
the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 119,
the mean node degree is 141.54, and the node degree mode is 5. The top 5 most central
nodes are 1121895.Q765_11350 (degree 1156), 1121895.Q765_17315 (degree 922), 1121895.Q765_04715
(degree 891), 1121895.Q765_04780 (degree 837) and 1121895.Q765_20215 (degree 817).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import FlavobacteriumRivuli

    # Then load the graph
    graph = FlavobacteriumRivuli()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
