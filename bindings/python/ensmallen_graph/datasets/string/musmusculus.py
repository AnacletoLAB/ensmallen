This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Mus musculus.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 

Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 17:49:53.263254

The undirected graph Mus musculus has 21291 nodes and 5972403 weighted edges, of
which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it has a density of 0.02635 and
has 19 connected components, where the component with most nodes has 21236 nodes
and the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree
is 424, the mean node degree is 561.03, and the node degree mode is 1. The top 5
most central nodes are 10090.ENSMUSP00000113942 (degree 6344), 10090.ENSMUSP00000001780
(degree 5894), 10090.ENSMUSP00000069851 (degree 5802), 10090.ENSMUSP00000104298 (degree
5490) and 10090.ENSMUSP00000031314 (degree 5085).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import MusMusculus

    # Then load the graph
    graph = MusMusculus()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
