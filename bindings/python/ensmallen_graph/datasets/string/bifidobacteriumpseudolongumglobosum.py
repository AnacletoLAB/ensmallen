This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Bifidobacterium pseudolongum globosum.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 16:22:53.838636

The undirected graph Bifidobacterium pseudolongum globosum has 1565 nodes
and 106550 weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense
as it has a density of 0.08706 and has 6 connected components, where the
component with most nodes has 1548 nodes and the component with the least
nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 118, the mean node degree
is 136.17, and the node degree mode is 2. The top 5 most central nodes
are 1690.BPSG_1412 (degree 764), 1690.BPSG_0788 (degree 743), 1690.BPSG_0036
(degree 738), 1690.BPSG_1573 (degree 634) and 1690.BPSG_0886 (degree 627).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import BifidobacteriumPseudolongumGlobosum

    # Then load the graph
    graph = BifidobacteriumPseudolongumGlobosum()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
