This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Acinetobacter sp. ADP1.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 

Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 18:23:51.044561

The undirected graph Acinetobacter sp. ADP1 has 3266 nodes and 380996 weighted edges,
of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it has a density of 0.07146 and
has 3 connected components, where the component with most nodes has 3262 nodes and
the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 207,
the mean node degree is 233.31, and the node degree mode is 7. The top 5 most central
nodes are 62977.ACIAD3030 (degree 1242), 62977.ACIAD3465 (degree 1159), 62977.ACIAD3072
(degree 1144), 62977.ACIAD2901 (degree 994) and 62977.ACIAD0768 (degree 960).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import AcinetobacterSp.Adp1

    # Then load the graph
    graph = AcinetobacterSp.Adp1()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
