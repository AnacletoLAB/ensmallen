This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Bacteroides massiliensis B84634.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 22:33:03.058299

The undirected graph Bacteroides massiliensis B84634 has 3896 nodes and
323920 weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense
as it has a density of 0.04269 and has 19 connected components, where the
component with most nodes has 3849 nodes and the component with the least
nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 143, the mean node degree
is 166.28, and the node degree mode is 4. The top 5 most central nodes
are 1121098.HMPREF1534_03844 (degree 1263), 1121098.HMPREF1534_02392 (degree
1193), 1121098.HMPREF1534_01553 (degree 1061), 1121098.HMPREF1534_00484
(degree 1051) and 1121098.HMPREF1534_01543 (degree 1042).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import BacteroidesMassiliensisB84634

    # Then load the graph
    graph = BacteroidesMassiliensisB84634()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
