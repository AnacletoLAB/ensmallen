This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Acromyrmex echinatior.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 19:43:35.854744

The undirected graph Acromyrmex echinatior has 8951 nodes and 869678 weighted
edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it has a density
of 0.02171 and has 16 connected components, where the component with most
nodes has 8920 nodes and the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes.
The graph median node degree is 127, the mean node degree is 194.32, and
the node degree mode is 1. The top 5 most central nodes are 103372.F4WG42
(degree 2528), 103372.F4X1E4 (degree 2152), 103372.F4WRE4 (degree 1670),
103372.F4WI50 (degree 1622) and 103372.F4WZJ9 (degree 1605).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import AcromyrmexEchinatior

    # Then load the graph
    graph = AcromyrmexEchinatior()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
