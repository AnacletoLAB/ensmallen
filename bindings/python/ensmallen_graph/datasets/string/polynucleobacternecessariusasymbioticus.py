This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Polynucleobacter necessarius asymbioticus.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 20:23:22.509396

The undirected graph Polynucleobacter necessarius asymbioticus has 2073
nodes and 145546 weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph
is dense as it has a density of 0.06777 and has 6 connected components,
where the component with most nodes has 2062 nodes and the component with
the least nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 120, the mean
node degree is 140.42, and the node degree mode is 2. The top 5 most central
nodes are 312153.Pnuc_1711 (degree 888), 312153.Pnuc_1422 (degree 739),
312153.Pnuc_1096 (degree 712), 312153.Pnuc_1423 (degree 669) and 312153.Pnuc_2033
(degree 667).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import PolynucleobacterNecessariusAsymbioticus

    # Then load the graph
    graph = PolynucleobacterNecessariusAsymbioticus()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
