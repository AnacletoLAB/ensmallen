This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Limnohabitans sp. Rim28.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 22:24:10.584886

The undirected graph Limnohabitans sp. Rim28 has 3060 nodes and 228603
weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it
has a density of 0.04884 and has 10 connected components, where the component
with most nodes has 3042 nodes and the component with the least nodes has
2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 117, the mean node degree is 149.41,
and the node degree mode is 1. The top 5 most central nodes are 1100720.ALKN01000044_gene1976
(degree 1072), 1100720.ALKN01000045_gene114 (degree 889), 1100720.ALKN01000007_gene2873
(degree 872), 1100720.ALKN01000040_gene2307 (degree 835) and 1100720.ALKN01000045_gene288
(degree 811).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import LimnohabitansSpRim28

    # Then load the graph
    graph = LimnohabitansSpRim28()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
