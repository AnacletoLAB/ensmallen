This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Hafnia alvei.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-03 23:05:59.200208

The undirected graph Hafnia alvei has 4030 nodes and 479711 weighted edges,
of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it has a density of
0.05909 and has 9 connected components, where the component with most nodes
has 4008 nodes and the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes. The
graph median node degree is 210, the mean node degree is 238.07, and the
node degree mode is 2. The top 5 most central nodes are 1453496.AT03_00415
(degree 1498), 1453496.AT03_10845 (degree 1368), 1453496.AT03_05455 (degree
1324), 1453496.AT03_18805 (degree 1309) and 1453496.AT03_14000 (degree
1307).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import HafniaAlvei

    # Then load the graph
    graph = HafniaAlvei()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
