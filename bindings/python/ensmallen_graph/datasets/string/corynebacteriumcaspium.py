This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Corynebacterium caspium.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 22:34:59.078957

The undirected graph Corynebacterium caspium has 1610 nodes and 120438
weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it
has a density of 0.09298 and has 5 connected components, where the component
with most nodes has 1601 nodes and the component with the least nodes has
2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 139, the mean node degree is 149.61,
and the node degree mode is 3. The top 5 most central nodes are 1121355.KB903378_gene397
(degree 702), 1121355.KB903376_gene1047 (degree 685), 1121355.KB903376_gene910
(degree 653), 1121355.KB903379_gene773 (degree 644) and 1121355.KB903378_gene380
(degree 614).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import CorynebacteriumCaspium

    # Then load the graph
    graph = CorynebacteriumCaspium()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
