This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Malus domestica.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 16:33:52.287871

The undirected graph Malus domestica has 42449 nodes and 14808790 weighted
edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it has a density
of 0.01644 and has 18 connected components, where the component with most
nodes has 42405 nodes and the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes.
The graph median node degree is 334, the mean node degree is 697.72, and
the node degree mode is 17. The top 5 most central nodes are 3750.XP_008383128.1
(degree 15876), 3750.XP_008379016.1 (degree 15713), 3750.XP_008391644.1
(degree 15403), 3750.XP_008375768.1 (degree 15340) and 3750.XP_008380050.1
(degree 15292).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import MalusDomestica

    # Then load the graph
    graph = MalusDomestica()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
