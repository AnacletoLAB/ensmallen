This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Triticum aestivum.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 17:07:44.007862

The undirected graph Triticum aestivum has 80231 nodes and 204981467 weighted
edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it has a density
of 0.06369 and has 6 connected components, where the component with most
nodes has 80205 nodes and the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes.
The graph median node degree is 3736, the mean node degree is 5109.78,
and the node degree mode is 297. The top 5 most central nodes are 4565.Traes_6BL_DFDCD5B11.1
(degree 42595), 4565.Traes_2BL_0021AA419.1 (degree 36012), 4565.Traes_2AL_44B0F2E5E.1
(degree 36012), 4565.Traes_2DL_4C7EBA068.2 (degree 36012) and 4565.Traes_3B_5DAEC6587.1
(degree 33909).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import TriticumAestivum

    # Then load the graph
    graph = TriticumAestivum()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
