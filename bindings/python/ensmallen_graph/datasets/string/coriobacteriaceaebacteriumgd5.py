This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Coriobacteriaceae bacterium GD5.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 23:28:29.439829

The undirected graph Coriobacteriaceae bacterium GD5 has 1845 nodes and
189371 weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is quite
dense as it has a density of 0.11132 and has 12 connected components, where
the component with most nodes has 1816 nodes and the component with the
least nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 174, the mean
node degree is 205.28, and the node degree mode is 1. The top 5 most central
nodes are 1232436.CAPF01000055_gene150 (degree 1099), 1232436.CAPF01000018_gene436
(degree 1026), 1232436.CAPF01000032_gene1364 (degree 914), 1232436.CAPF01000004_gene219
(degree 887) and 1232436.CAPF01000063_gene1604 (degree 858).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import CoriobacteriaceaeBacteriumGd5

    # Then load the graph
    graph = CoriobacteriaceaeBacteriumGd5()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
