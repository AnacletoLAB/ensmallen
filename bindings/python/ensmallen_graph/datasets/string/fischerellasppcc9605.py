This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Fischerella sp. PCC9605.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 23:08:06.186109

The undirected graph Fischerella sp. PCC9605 has 6380 nodes and 713027
weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it
has a density of 0.03504 and has 55 connected components, where the component
with most nodes has 6207 nodes and the component with the least nodes has
2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 194, the mean node degree is 223.52,
and the node degree mode is 1. The top 5 most central nodes are 1173024.KI912148_gene2585
(degree 1973), 1173024.KI912148_gene2777 (degree 1898), 1173024.KI912148_gene4127
(degree 1808), 1173024.KI912148_gene3521 (degree 1727) and 1173024.KI912151_gene1675
(degree 1637).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import FischerellaSpPcc9605

    # Then load the graph
    graph = FischerellaSpPcc9605()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
