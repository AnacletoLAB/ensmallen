This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Streptomyces niveus.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 

Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-03 22:07:04.966281

The undirected graph Streptomyces niveus has 7542 nodes and 856326 weighted edges,
of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it has a density of 0.03011 and
has 33 connected components, where the component with most nodes has 7471 nodes and
the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 192,
the mean node degree is 227.08, and the node degree mode is 2. The top 5 most central
nodes are 1352941.M877_09885 (degree 3435), 1352941.M877_32010 (degree 2183), 1352941.M877_08375
(degree 2016), 1352941.M877_15005 (degree 1921) and 1352941.M877_31850 (degree 1803).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import StreptomycesNiveus

    # Then load the graph
    graph = StreptomycesNiveus()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
