This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Wolbachia sp. Dsi.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 23:31:41.495885

The undirected graph Wolbachia sp. Dsi has 1018 nodes and 60038 weighted
edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is quite dense as it has
a density of 0.11598 and has 5 connected components, where the component
with most nodes has 1007 nodes and the component with the least nodes has
2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 106, the mean node degree is 117.95,
and the node degree mode is 1. The top 5 most central nodes are 1236908.wNo_07860
(degree 540), 1236908.wNo_02580 (degree 509), 1236908.wNo_01950 (degree
470), 1236908.wNo_01030 (degree 452) and 1236908.wNo_00760 (degree 435).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import WolbachiaSpDsi

    # Then load the graph
    graph = WolbachiaSpDsi()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
