This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Streptomyces auratus.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 23:04:27.879013

The undirected graph Streptomyces auratus has 6614 nodes and 954340 weighted
edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it has a density
of 0.04364 and has 24 connected components, where the component with most
nodes has 6559 nodes and the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes.
The graph median node degree is 241, the mean node degree is 288.58, and
the node degree mode is 2. The top 5 most central nodes are 1160718.SU9_05766
(degree 3179), 1160718.SU9_33643 (degree 2069), 1160718.SU9_20319 (degree
1966), 1160718.SU9_28516 (degree 1896) and 1160718.SU9_23680 (degree 1876).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import StreptomycesAuratus

    # Then load the graph
    graph = StreptomycesAuratus()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
