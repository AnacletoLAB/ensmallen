This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Solirubrobacterales bacterium URHD0059.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-03 22:14:42.020635

The undirected graph Solirubrobacterales bacterium URHD0059 has 6245 nodes
and 620165 weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense
as it has a density of 0.03181 and has 32 connected components, where the
component with most nodes has 6172 nodes and the component with the least
nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 159, the mean node degree
is 198.61, and the node degree mode is 2. The top 5 most central nodes
are 1380390.JIAT01000011_gene2883 (degree 3399), 1380390.JIAT01000009_gene1345
(degree 2550), 1380390.JIAT01000014_gene6288 (degree 2548), 1380390.JIAT01000016_gene5595
(degree 1866) and 1380390.JIAT01000009_gene1947 (degree 1730).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import SolirubrobacteralesBacteriumUrhd0059

    # Then load the graph
    graph = SolirubrobacteralesBacteriumUrhd0059()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
