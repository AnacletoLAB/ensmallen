This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Acinetobacter ursingii.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 

Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 22:03:17.141248

The undirected graph Acinetobacter ursingii has 3246 nodes and 281981 weighted edges,
of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it has a density of 0.05354 and
has 9 connected components, where the component with most nodes has 3226 nodes and
the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 148,
the mean node degree is 173.74, and the node degree mode is 3. The top 5 most central
nodes are 981336.F944_03029 (degree 1194), 981336.F944_03155 (degree 1119), 981336.F944_02292
(degree 994), 981336.F944_03179 (degree 985) and 981336.F944_01981 (degree 903).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import AcinetobacterUrsingii

    # Then load the graph
    graph = AcinetobacterUrsingii()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
