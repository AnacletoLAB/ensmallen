This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Solanum lycopersicum.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 16:40:00.770334

The undirected graph Solanum lycopersicum has 25316 nodes and 4831987 weighted
edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it has a density
of 0.01508 and has 16 connected components, where the component with most
nodes has 25283 nodes and the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes.
The graph median node degree is 178, the mean node degree is 381.73, and
the node degree mode is 2. The top 5 most central nodes are 4081.Solyc05g018300.2.1
(degree 8202), 4081.Solyc01g109830.2.1 (degree 6511), 4081.Solyc09g008130.2.1
(degree 5521), 4081.Solyc11g013810.1.1 (degree 4874) and 4081.Solyc07g023990.1.1
(degree 4423).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import SolanumLycopersicum

    # Then load the graph
    graph = SolanumLycopersicum()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
