This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Streptococcus constellatus pharyngis SK1060.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 22:11:58.877429

The undirected graph Streptococcus constellatus pharyngis SK1060 has 2435
nodes and 241282 weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph
is dense as it has a density of 0.08142 and has 5 connected components,
where the component with most nodes has 2426 nodes and the component with
the least nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 146, the mean
node degree is 198.18, and the node degree mode is 9. The top 5 most central
nodes are 1035184.HMPREF1042_2114 (degree 1132), 1035184.HMPREF1042_0948
(degree 1072), 1035184.HMPREF1042_2450 (degree 1047), 1035184.HMPREF1042_0093
(degree 1035) and 1035184.HMPREF1042_2159 (degree 908).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import StreptococcusConstellatusPharyngisSk1060

    # Then load the graph
    graph = StreptococcusConstellatusPharyngisSk1060()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
