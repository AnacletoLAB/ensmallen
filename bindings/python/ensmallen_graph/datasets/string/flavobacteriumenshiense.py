This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Flavobacterium enshiense.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 

Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 22:24:54.370531

The undirected graph Flavobacterium enshiense has 2810 nodes and 204092 weighted
edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it has a density of 0.05171
and has 13 connected components, where the component with most nodes has 2774 nodes
and the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree
is 126, the mean node degree is 145.26, and the node degree mode is 3. The top 5
most central nodes are 1107311.Q767_06845 (degree 1025), 1107311.Q767_03485 (degree
999), 1107311.Q767_15045 (degree 846), 1107311.Q767_10195 (degree 845) and 1107311.Q767_03535
(degree 764).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import FlavobacteriumEnshiense

    # Then load the graph
    graph = FlavobacteriumEnshiense()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
