This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Pseudomonas fragi.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 22:56:48.683156

The undirected graph Pseudomonas fragi has 4364 nodes and 423858 weighted
edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it has a density
of 0.04452 and has 9 connected components, where the component with most
nodes has 4342 nodes and the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes.
The graph median node degree is 160, the mean node degree is 194.25, and
the node degree mode is 1. The top 5 most central nodes are 1136138.JH604624_gene4180
(degree 1732), 1136138.JH604622_gene877 (degree 1232), 1136138.JH604626_gene118
(degree 1232), 1136138.JH604625_gene3602 (degree 1221) and 1136138.JH604622_gene665
(degree 1218).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import PseudomonasFragi

    # Then load the graph
    graph = PseudomonasFragi()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
