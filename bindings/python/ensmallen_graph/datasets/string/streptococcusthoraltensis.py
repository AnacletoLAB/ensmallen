This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Streptococcus thoraltensis.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 

Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 22:50:58.700058

The undirected graph Streptococcus thoraltensis has 2168 nodes and 194445 weighted
edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it has a density of 0.08278
and has 12 connected components, where the component with most nodes has 2137 nodes
and the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree
is 142, the mean node degree is 179.38, and the node degree mode is 2. The top 5
most central nodes are 1123318.KB904609_gene212 (degree 982), 1123318.KB904633_gene1295
(degree 932), 1123318.KB904596_gene1358 (degree 873), 1123318.KB904586_gene435 (degree
869) and 1123318.KB904632_gene1242 (degree 763).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import StreptococcusThoraltensis

    # Then load the graph
    graph = StreptococcusThoraltensis()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
