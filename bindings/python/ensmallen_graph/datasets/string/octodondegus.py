This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Octodon degus.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 17:51:39.852708

The undirected graph Octodon degus has 20053 nodes and 6862741 weighted
edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it has a density
of 0.03413 and is connected, as it has a single component. The graph median
node degree is 529, the mean node degree is 684.46, and the node degree
mode is 43. The top 5 most central nodes are 10160.XP_004629142.1 (degree
5844), 10160.XP_004643512.1 (degree 5660), 10160.XP_004631848.1 (degree
5350), 10160.XP_004648482.1 (degree 5199) and 10160.XP_004622998.1 (degree
5125).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import OctodonDegus

    # Then load the graph
    graph = OctodonDegus()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
