This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Acetobacter nitrogenifigens.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 22:29:11.688084

The undirected graph Acetobacter nitrogenifigens has 3560 nodes and 320564
weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it
has a density of 0.05060 and has 26 connected components, where the component
with most nodes has 3495 nodes and the component with the least nodes has
2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 146, the mean node degree is 180.09,
and the node degree mode is 2. The top 5 most central nodes are 1120919.AUBI01000001_gene3085
(degree 1272), 1120919.AUBI01000015_gene2777 (degree 1215), 1120919.AUBI01000034_gene2823
(degree 999), 1120919.AUBI01000016_gene3577 (degree 987) and 1120919.AUBI01000005_gene875
(degree 957).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import AcetobacterNitrogenifigens

    # Then load the graph
    graph = AcetobacterNitrogenifigens()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
