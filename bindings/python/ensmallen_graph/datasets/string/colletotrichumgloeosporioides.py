This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Colletotrichum gloeosporioides.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 20:56:31.655931

The undirected graph Colletotrichum gloeosporioides has 10468 nodes and
1082981 weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense
as it has a density of 0.01977 and has 26 connected components, where the
component with most nodes has 10414 nodes and the component with the least
nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 101, the mean node degree
is 206.91, and the node degree mode is 1. The top 5 most central nodes
are 474922.ELA32094 (degree 2687), 474922.ELA35078 (degree 2293), 474922.ELA32515
(degree 2179), 474922.ELA23732 (degree 2115) and 474922.ELA25652 (degree
2096).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import ColletotrichumGloeosporioides

    # Then load the graph
    graph = ColletotrichumGloeosporioides()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
