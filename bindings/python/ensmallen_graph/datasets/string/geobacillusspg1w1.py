This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Geobacillus sp. G1w1.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-03 22:53:27.783185

The undirected graph Geobacillus sp. G1w1 has 3090 nodes and 275839 weighted
edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it has a density
of 0.05780 and has 16 connected components, where the component with most
nodes has 3058 nodes and the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes.
The graph median node degree is 156, the mean node degree is 178.54, and
the node degree mode is 1. The top 5 most central nodes are 1430331.EP10_07250
(degree 1179), 1430331.EP10_08745 (degree 1000), 1430331.EP10_02670 (degree
956), 1430331.EP10_16735 (degree 858) and 1430331.EP10_05360 (degree 857).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import GeobacillusSpG1w1

    # Then load the graph
    graph = GeobacillusSpG1w1()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
