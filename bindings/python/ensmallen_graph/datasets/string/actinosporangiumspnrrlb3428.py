This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Actinosporangium sp. NRRLB3428.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-03 23:08:02.048506

The undirected graph Actinosporangium sp. NRRLB3428 has 7478 nodes and
1056652 weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense
as it has a density of 0.03780 and has 34 connected components, where the
component with most nodes has 7401 nodes and the component with the least
nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 239, the mean node degree
is 282.60, and the node degree mode is 2. The top 5 most central nodes
are 1463820.JOGW01000001_gene5213 (degree 3597), 1463820.JOGW01000011_gene3062
(degree 2783), 1463820.JOGW01000002_gene5953 (degree 2085), 1463820.JOGW01000015_gene2462
(degree 2047) and 1463820.JOGW01000013_gene4348 (degree 2032).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import ActinosporangiumSpNrrlb3428

    # Then load the graph
    graph = ActinosporangiumSpNrrlb3428()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
