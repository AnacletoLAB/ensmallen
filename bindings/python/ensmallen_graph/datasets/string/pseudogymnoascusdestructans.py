This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Pseudogymnoascus destructans.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 21:26:42.329843

The undirected graph Pseudogymnoascus destructans has 5959 nodes and 590113
weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it
has a density of 0.03324 and has 20 connected components, where the component
with most nodes has 5917 nodes and the component with the least nodes has
2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 135, the mean node degree is 198.06,
and the node degree mode is 1. The top 5 most central nodes are 655981.L8G786
(degree 1412), 655981.L8GC23 (degree 1380), 655981.L8FSG6 (degree 1320),
655981.L8G9T8 (degree 1232) and 655981.L8FP22 (degree 1214).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import PseudogymnoascusDestructans

    # Then load the graph
    graph = PseudogymnoascusDestructans()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
