This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Mycobacterium neoaurum.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 

Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 21:33:35.260300

The undirected graph Mycobacterium neoaurum has 4628 nodes and 625532 weighted edges,
of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it has a density of 0.05842 and
has 18 connected components, where the component with most nodes has 4576 nodes and
the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 222,
the mean node degree is 270.32, and the node degree mode is 3. The top 5 most central
nodes are 700508.D174_19850 (degree 1860), 700508.D174_09325 (degree 1723), 700508.D174_09195
(degree 1719), 700508.D174_17465 (degree 1635) and 700508.D174_10320 (degree 1436).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import MycobacteriumNeoaurum

    # Then load the graph
    graph = MycobacteriumNeoaurum()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
