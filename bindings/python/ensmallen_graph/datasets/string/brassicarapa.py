This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Brassica rapa.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 16:31:05.280347

The undirected graph Brassica rapa has 33516 nodes and 10088511 weighted
edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it has a density
of 0.01796 and has 4 connected components, where the component with most
nodes has 33507 nodes and the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes.
The graph median node degree is 289, the mean node degree is 602.01, and
the node degree mode is 5. The top 5 most central nodes are 3711.Bra033729.1-P
(degree 12323), 3711.Bra036365.1-P (degree 11518), 3711.Bra040822.1-P (degree
11477), 3711.Bra040756.1-P (degree 11445) and 3711.Bra034892.1-P (degree
11395).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import BrassicaRapa

    # Then load the graph
    graph = BrassicaRapa()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
