This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Lactobacillus shenzhenensis.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 23:28:02.925267

The undirected graph Lactobacillus shenzhenensis has 3097 nodes and 222237
weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it
has a density of 0.04636 and has 23 connected components, where the component
with most nodes has 3041 nodes and the component with the least nodes has
2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 108, the mean node degree is 143.52,
and the node degree mode is 2. The top 5 most central nodes are 1231336.L248_0037
(degree 1205), 1231336.L248_0798 (degree 1039), 1231336.L248_2562 (degree
1001), 1231336.L248_2653 (degree 864) and 1231336.L248_1275 (degree 788).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import LactobacillusShenzhenensis

    # Then load the graph
    graph = LactobacillusShenzhenensis()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Whether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
