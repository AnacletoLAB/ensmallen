This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Helicobacter sp. MIT016451.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 

Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 20:47:45.077766

The undirected graph Helicobacter sp. MIT016451 has 1776 nodes and 111593 weighted
edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it has a density of 0.07080
and has 15 connected components, where the component with most nodes has 1743 nodes
and the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree
is 102, the mean node degree is 125.67, and the node degree mode is 7. The top 5
most central nodes are 425400.LS65_04285 (degree 819), 425400.LS65_03415 (degree
772), 425400.LS65_01330 (degree 733), 425400.LS65_00505 (degree 733) and 425400.LS65_01860
(degree 602).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import HelicobacterSp.Mit016451

    # Then load the graph
    graph = HelicobacterSp.Mit016451()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
