This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Mycoplasma putrefaciens Mput9231.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-03 21:22:27.703620

The undirected graph Mycoplasma putrefaciens Mput9231 has 657 nodes and
34673 weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is quite
dense as it has a density of 0.16090 and has 4 connected components, where
the component with most nodes has 651 nodes and the component with the
least nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 91, the mean node
degree is 105.55, and the node degree mode is 11. The top 5 most central
nodes are 1292033.MPUT9231_4670 (degree 357), 1292033.MPUT9231_5470 (degree
339), 1292033.MPUT9231_5340 (degree 321), 1292033.MPUT9231_4430 (degree
317) and 1292033.MPUT9231_2570 (degree 286).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import MycoplasmaPutrefaciensMput9231

    # Then load the graph
    graph = MycoplasmaPutrefaciensMput9231()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
