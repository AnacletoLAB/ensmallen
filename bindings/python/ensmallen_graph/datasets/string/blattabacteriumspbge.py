"""
This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Blattabacterium sp. Bge.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 20:29:46.904799

The undirected graph Blattabacterium sp. Bge has 589 nodes and 34702 weighted
edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is quite dense as it has
a density of 0.20040 and is connected, as it has a single component. The
graph median node degree is 108, the mean node degree is 117.83, and the
node degree mode is 77. The top 5 most central nodes are 331104.BLBBGE_512
(degree 363), 331104.BLBBGE_478 (degree 357), 331104.BLBBGE_311 (degree
347), 331104.BLBBGE_160 (degree 346) and 331104.BLBBGE_226 (degree 323).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import BlattabacteriumSpBge

    # Then load the graph
    graph = BlattabacteriumSpBge()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Whether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
