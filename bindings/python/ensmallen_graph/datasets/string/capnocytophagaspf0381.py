This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Capnocytophaga sp. F0381.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 22:54:47.127857

The undirected graph Capnocytophaga sp. F0381 has 2681 nodes and 159255
weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it
has a density of 0.04433 and has 27 connected components, where the component
with most nodes has 2598 nodes and the component with the least nodes has
2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 92, the mean node degree is 118.80,
and the node degree mode is 4. The top 5 most central nodes are 1127692.HMPREF9075_00562
(degree 1099), 1127692.HMPREF9075_01389 (degree 837), 1127692.HMPREF9075_00654
(degree 817), 1127692.HMPREF9075_01777 (degree 731) and 1127692.HMPREF9075_01367
(degree 635).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import CapnocytophagaSpF0381

    # Then load the graph
    graph = CapnocytophagaSpF0381()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
