This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Photodesmus blepharus.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 23:09:45.123719

The undirected graph Photodesmus blepharus has 914 nodes and 58176 weighted
edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is quite dense as it has
a density of 0.13943 and is connected, as it has a single component. The
graph median node degree is 113, the mean node degree is 127.30, and the
node degree mode is 92. The top 5 most central nodes are 1179155.CF67_17045
(degree 505), 1179155.CF67_01022 (degree 450), 1179155.CF67_04178 (degree
394), 1179155.CF67_03004 (degree 390) and 1179155.CF67_14041 (degree 351).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import PhotodesmusBlepharus

    # Then load the graph
    graph = PhotodesmusBlepharus()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
