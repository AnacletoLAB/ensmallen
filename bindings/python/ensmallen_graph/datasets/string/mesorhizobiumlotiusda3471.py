This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Mesorhizobium loti USDA3471.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 22:13:57.600579

The undirected graph Mesorhizobium loti USDA3471 has 6242 nodes and 978349
weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it
has a density of 0.05023 and has 37 connected components, where the component
with most nodes has 6159 nodes and the component with the least nodes has
2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 253, the mean node degree is 313.47,
and the node degree mode is 1. The top 5 most central nodes are 1040983.AXAE01000035_gene2351
(degree 2408), 1040983.AXAE01000009_gene5202 (degree 2230), 1040983.AXAE01000013_gene5635
(degree 2145), 1040983.AXAE01000018_gene5953 (degree 2142) and 1040983.AXAE01000012_gene2159
(degree 1990).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import MesorhizobiumLotiUsda3471

    # Then load the graph
    graph = MesorhizobiumLotiUsda3471()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
