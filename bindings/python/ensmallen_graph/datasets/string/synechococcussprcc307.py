This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Synechococcus sp. RCC307.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 20:26:27.325635

The undirected graph Synechococcus sp. RCC307 has 2523 nodes and 130879
weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it
has a density of 0.04114 and has 48 connected components, where the component
with most nodes has 2375 nodes and the component with the least nodes has
2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 84, the mean node degree is 103.75,
and the node degree mode is 3. The top 5 most central nodes are 316278.SynRCC307_1669
(degree 852), 316278.SynRCC307_0574 (degree 575), 316278.SynRCC307_2164
(degree 564), 316278.SynRCC307_1703 (degree 531) and 316278.SynRCC307_1751
(degree 521).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import SynechococcusSpRcc307

    # Then load the graph
    graph = SynechococcusSpRcc307()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
