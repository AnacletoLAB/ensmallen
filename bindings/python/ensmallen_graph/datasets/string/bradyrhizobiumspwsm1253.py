This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Bradyrhizobium sp. WSM1253.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 20:27:31.577772

The undirected graph Bradyrhizobium sp. WSM1253 has 7858 nodes and 978720
weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it
has a density of 0.03170 and has 110 connected components, where the component
with most nodes has 7582 nodes and the component with the least nodes has
2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 194, the mean node degree is 249.10,
and the node degree mode is 1. The top 5 most central nodes are 319003.Bra1253DRAFT_02817
(degree 3534), 319003.Bra1253DRAFT_03255 (degree 2662), 319003.Bra1253DRAFT_04484
(degree 2640), 319003.Bra1253DRAFT_03060 (degree 2309) and 319003.Bra1253DRAFT_04123
(degree 2267).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import BradyrhizobiumSpWsm1253

    # Then load the graph
    graph = BradyrhizobiumSpWsm1253()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
