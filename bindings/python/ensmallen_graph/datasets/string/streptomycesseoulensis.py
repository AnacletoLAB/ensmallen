This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Streptomyces seoulensis.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-05 17:17:00.098849

The undirected graph Streptomyces seoulensis has 5653 nodes and 859833
weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it
has a density of 0.05382 and has 23 connected components, where the component
with most nodes has 5582 nodes and the component with the least nodes has
2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 258, the mean node degree is 304.20,
and the node degree mode is 2. The top 5 most central nodes are 73044.JNXP01000022_gene2338
(degree 2860), 73044.JNXP01000016_gene533 (degree 1949), 73044.JNXP01000020_gene3654
(degree 1914), 73044.JNXP01000001_gene4618 (degree 1792) and 73044.JNXP01000001_gene4396
(degree 1710).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import StreptomycesSeoulensis

    # Then load the graph
    graph = StreptomycesSeoulensis()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
