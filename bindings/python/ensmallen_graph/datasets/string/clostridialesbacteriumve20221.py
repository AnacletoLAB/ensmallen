This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Clostridiales bacterium VE20221.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 23:29:07.766232

The undirected graph Clostridiales bacterium VE20221 has 4880 nodes and
530498 weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense
as it has a density of 0.04456 and has 20 connected components, where the
component with most nodes has 4833 nodes and the component with the least
nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 170, the mean node degree
is 217.42, and the node degree mode is 1. The top 5 most central nodes
are 1232453.BAIF02000002_gene1315 (degree 2039), 1232453.BAIF02000089_gene2886
(degree 1916), 1232453.BAIF02000118_gene4592 (degree 1899), 1232453.BAIF02000066_gene2021
(degree 1596) and 1232453.BAIF02000086_gene331 (degree 1380).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import ClostridialesBacteriumVe20221

    # Then load the graph
    graph = ClostridialesBacteriumVe20221()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
