"""
This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Pyrococcus furiosus.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 19:57:11.843208

The undirected graph Pyrococcus furiosus has 2056 nodes and 134134 weighted
edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it has a density
of 0.06349 and has 7 connected components, where the component with most
nodes has 2039 nodes and the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes.
The graph median node degree is 111, the mean node degree is 130.48, and
the node degree mode is 5. The top 5 most central nodes are 186497.PF1874
(degree 662), 186497.PF1920 (degree 628), 186497.PF1974 (degree 621), 186497.PF1057
(degree 557) and 186497.PF1778 (degree 552).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import PyrococcusFuriosus

    # Then load the graph
    graph = PyrococcusFuriosus()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
