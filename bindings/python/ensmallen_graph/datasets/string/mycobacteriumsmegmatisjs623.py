This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Mycobacterium smegmatis JS623.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 21:35:13.661612

The undirected graph Mycobacterium smegmatis JS623 has 6130 nodes and 760236
weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it
has a density of 0.04047 and has 26 connected components, where the component
with most nodes has 6072 nodes and the component with the least nodes has
2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 206, the mean node degree is 248.04,
and the node degree mode is 4. The top 5 most central nodes are 710686.Mycsm_04419
(degree 2858), 710686.Mycsm_03031 (degree 2451), 710686.Mycsm_06187 (degree
2266), 710686.Mycsm_04200 (degree 2005) and 710686.Mycsm_01137 (degree
1987).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import MycobacteriumSmegmatisJs623

    # Then load the graph
    graph = MycobacteriumSmegmatisJs623()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
