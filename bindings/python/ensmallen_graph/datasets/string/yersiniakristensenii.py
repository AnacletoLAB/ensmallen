This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Yersinia kristensenii.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 

Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 17:55:41.915147

The undirected graph Yersinia kristensenii has 3891 nodes and 352573 weighted
edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it has a density
of 0.04659 and has 5 connected components, where the component with most
nodes has 3881 nodes and the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes.
The graph median node degree is 148, the mean node degree is 181.22, and
the node degree mode is 2. The top 5 most central nodes are 28152.DJ57_3423
(degree 1403), 28152.DJ57_2287 (degree 1300), 28152.DJ57_3852 (degree 1148),
28152.DJ57_1210 (degree 1142) and 28152.DJ57_3854 (degree 1078).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import YersiniaKristensenii

    # Then load the graph
    graph = YersiniaKristensenii()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
