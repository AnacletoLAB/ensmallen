This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Geomicrobium sp. JCM19038.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-03 23:07:20.259233

The undirected graph Geomicrobium sp. JCM19038 has 4067 nodes and 440978
weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it
has a density of 0.05333 and has 11 connected components, where the component
with most nodes has 4043 nodes and the component with the least nodes has
2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 203, the mean node degree is 216.86,
and the node degree mode is 3. The top 5 most central nodes are 1460635.JCM19038_3558
(degree 1318), 1460635.JCM19038_4012 (degree 1235), 1460635.JCM19038_615
(degree 1203), 1460635.JCM19038_1980 (degree 1009) and 1460635.JCM19038_120
(degree 1004).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import GeomicrobiumSpJcm19038

    # Then load the graph
    graph = GeomicrobiumSpJcm19038()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
