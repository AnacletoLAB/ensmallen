"""
This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Kinetoplastibacterium oncopeltii.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 23:18:21.404919

The undirected graph Kinetoplastibacterium oncopeltii has 694 nodes and
36342 weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is quite
dense as it has a density of 0.15113 and is connected, as it has a single
component. The graph median node degree is 94, the mean node degree is
104.73, and the node degree mode is 96. The top 5 most central nodes are
1208920.CONE_0298 (degree 424), 1208920.CONE_0642 (degree 417), 1208920.CONE_0578
(degree 392), 1208920.CONE_0530 (degree 329) and 1208920.CONE_0027 (degree
312).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import KinetoplastibacteriumOncopeltii

    # Then load the graph
    graph = KinetoplastibacteriumOncopeltii()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
