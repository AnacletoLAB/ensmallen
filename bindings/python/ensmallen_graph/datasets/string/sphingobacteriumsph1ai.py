This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Sphingobacterium sp. H1ai.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-03 22:39:47.388328

The undirected graph Sphingobacterium sp. H1ai has 5562 nodes and 487797
weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it
has a density of 0.03154 and has 32 connected components, where the component
with most nodes has 5478 nodes and the component with the least nodes has
2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 155, the mean node degree is 175.40,
and the node degree mode is 2. The top 5 most central nodes are 1408813.AYMG01000001_gene3374
(degree 1461), 1408813.AYMG01000008_gene3829 (degree 1371), 1408813.AYMG01000004_gene4584
(degree 1228), 1408813.AYMG01000009_gene3187 (degree 1157) and 1408813.AYMG01000002_gene3077
(degree 1065).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import SphingobacteriumSpH1ai

    # Then load the graph
    graph = SphingobacteriumSpH1ai()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
