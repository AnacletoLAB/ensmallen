This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Spirosoma linguale.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 

Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 21:01:59.779501

The undirected graph Spirosoma linguale has 6455 nodes and 905517 weighted edges,
of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it has a density of 0.04347 and
has 29 connected components, where the component with most nodes has 6396 nodes and
the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 247,
the mean node degree is 280.56, and the node degree mode is 1. The top 5 most central
nodes are 504472.Slin_0543 (degree 1871), 504472.Slin_0621 (degree 1848), 504472.Slin_4604
(degree 1556), 504472.Slin_3312 (degree 1479) and 504472.Slin_0474 (degree 1440).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import SpirosomaLinguale

    # Then load the graph
    graph = SpirosomaLinguale()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
