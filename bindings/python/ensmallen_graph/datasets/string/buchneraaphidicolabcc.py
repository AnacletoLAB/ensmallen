This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Buchnera aphidicola BCc.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 20:35:53.917957

The undirected graph Buchnera aphidicola BCc has 361 nodes and 18621 weighted
edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is quite dense as it has
a density of 0.28657 and is connected, as it has a single component. The
graph median node degree is 101, the mean node degree is 103.16, and the
node degree mode is 27. The top 5 most central nodes are 372461.BCc_011
(degree 211), 372461.BCc_165 (degree 207), 372461.BCc_142 (degree 206),
372461.BCc_344 (degree 206) and 372461.BCc_096 (degree 205).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import BuchneraAphidicolaBcc

    # Then load the graph
    graph = BuchneraAphidicolaBcc()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
