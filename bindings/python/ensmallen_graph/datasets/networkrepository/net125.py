This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph net125.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 12:13:19.515032

The undirected graph net125 has 36720 nodes and 1306960 unweighted edges,
of which 36720 are self-loops. The graph is sparse as it has a density
of 0.00191 and has 2 connected components, where the component with most
nodes has 34884 nodes and the component with the least nodes has 1836 nodes.
The graph median node degree is 69, the mean node degree is 70.19, and
the node degree mode is 69. The top 5 most central nodes are 4760 (degree
231), 4759 (degree 231), 4758 (degree 231), 4757 (degree 231) and 4756
(degree 231).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import Net125

    # Then load the graph
    graph = Net125()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
