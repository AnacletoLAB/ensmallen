This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph cvxbqp1.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 11:08:16.254004

The undirected graph cvxbqp1 has 50000 nodes and 199984 weighted edges,
of which 50000 are self-loops. The graph is quite sparse as it has a density
of 0.00014 and has 6 connected components, where the component with most
nodes has 40000 nodes and the component with the least nodes has 16 nodes.
The graph median node degree is 5, the mean node degree is 7.00, and the
node degree mode is 5. The top 5 most central nodes are 49994 (degree 9),
49988 (degree 9), 49982 (degree 9), 49976 (degree 9) and 49970 (degree
9).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import Cvxbqp1

    # Then load the graph
    graph = Cvxbqp1()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
