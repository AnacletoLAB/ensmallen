This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph dbpedia.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-05 19:39:20.173292

The undirected graph dbpedia has 495936 nodes with 4 different node types:
3 (nodes number 258851), 1 (nodes number 127572), 2 (nodes number 101730)
and 4 (nodes number 7783) and 921710 unweighted edges, of which none are
self-loops. The graph is extremely sparse as it has a density of 0.00001
and has 26083 connected components, where the component with most nodes
has 439422 nodes and the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes. The
graph median node degree is 2, the mean node degree is 3.72, and the node
degree mode is 1. The top 5 most central nodes are 488248 (degree 24821),
488345 (degree 22124), 127632 (degree 17997), 488243 (degree 16718) and
488325 (degree 11779).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import Dbpedia

    # Then load the graph
    graph = Dbpedia()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
