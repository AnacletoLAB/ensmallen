This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph eat.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 11:09:47.650888

The undirected multigraph eat has 23132 nodes and 307305 unweighted edges
with 9 different edge types:  the 5 most common are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, of
which 552 are self-loops and 19318 are parallel. The graph is sparse as
it has a density of 0.00111 and is connected, as it has a single component.
The graph median node degree is 5, the mean node degree is 26.55, and the
node degree mode is 2. The top 5 most central nodes are 3980 (degree 1071),
3730 (degree 1035), 9369 (degree 845), 746 (degree 831) and 3071 (degree
790).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import Eat

    # Then load the graph
    graph = Eat()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
