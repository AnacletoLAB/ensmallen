This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph soc-BlogCatalog-ASU.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-04 08:50:39.241812

The undirected graph soc-BlogCatalog-ASU has 10312 nodes with 38 different
node types:  the 5 most common are 8 (nodes number 1423), 5 (nodes number
843), 2 (nodes number 759), 6 (nodes number 735) and 24 (nodes number 586)
and 333983 unweighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is
sparse as it has a density of 0.00628 and is connected, as it has a single
component. The graph median node degree is 21, the mean node degree is
64.78, and the node degree mode is 2. The top 5 most central nodes are
4839 (degree 3992), 176 (degree 3925), 4374 (degree 3449), 8157 (degree
2976) and 1226 (degree 2780).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import SocBlogcatalogAsu

    # Then load the graph
    graph = SocBlogcatalogAsu()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
