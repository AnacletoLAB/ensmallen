This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph roadNet-CA.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 

Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 12:17:01.701556

The undirected graph roadNet-CA has 1965206 nodes and 2766607 unweighted edges, of
which none are self-loops. The graph is extremely sparse as it has a density of 0.00000
and has 2638 connected components, where the component with most nodes has 1957027
nodes and the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree
is 3, the mean node degree is 2.82, and the node degree mode is 3. The top 5 most
central nodes are 562819 (degree 12), 521169 (degree 10), 534752 (degree 10), 1795417
(degree 9) and 1872331 (degree 8).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import RoadnetCa

    # Then load the graph
    graph = RoadnetCa()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
