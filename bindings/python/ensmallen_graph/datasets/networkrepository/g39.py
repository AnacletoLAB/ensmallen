This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph G39.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 10:03:45.731095

The undirected graph G39 has 2000 nodes and 11778 unweighted edges with
2 different edge types: 1 and -1, of which none are self-loops. The graph
is sparse as it has a density of 0.00589 and is connected, as it has a
single component. The graph median node degree is 8, the mean node degree
is 11.78, and the node degree mode is 6. The top 5 most central nodes are
5 (degree 210), 4 (degree 202), 3 (degree 194), 9 (degree 179) and 2 (degree
167).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import G39

    # Then load the graph
    graph = G39()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
