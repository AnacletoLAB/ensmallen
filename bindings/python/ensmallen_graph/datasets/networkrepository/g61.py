"""
This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph G61.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 

Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 10:07:40.737107

The undirected graph G61 has 6957 nodes and 17148 unweighted edges with
2 different edge types: 1 and -1, of which none are self-loops. The graph
is quite sparse as it has a density of 0.00071 and has 2 connected components,
where the component with most nodes has 6955 nodes and the component with
the least nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 5, the mean
node degree is 4.93, and the node degree mode is 4. The top 5 most central
nodes are 4048 (degree 14), 1291 (degree 14), 1339 (degree 14), 5436 (degree
14) and 3012 (degree 13).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import G61

    # Then load the graph
    graph = G61()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
