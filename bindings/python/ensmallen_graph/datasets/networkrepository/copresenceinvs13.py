This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph copresence-InVS13.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-03 23:41:21.038230

The undirected multigraph copresence-InVS13 has 95 nodes and 394247 unweighted
edges with 20129 different edge types:  the 5 most common are 29720, 29740,
30000, 30020 and 29480, of which none are self-loops and 780664 are parallel.
The graph is extremely dense as it has a density of 0.87682 and is connected,
as it has a single component. The graph median node degree is 6887, the
mean node degree is 8299.94 and the node degree mode is 6069. The top 5
most central nodes are 603 (degree 27488), 209 (degree 26374), 875 (degree
23639), 987 (degree 21887) and 48 (degree 20237).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import CopresenceInvs13

    # Then load the graph
    graph = CopresenceInvs13()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
