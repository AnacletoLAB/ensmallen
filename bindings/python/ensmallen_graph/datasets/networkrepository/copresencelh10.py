This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph copresence-LH10.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-03 23:41:59.727426

The undirected multigraph copresence-LH10 has 73 nodes and 150126 unweighted
edges with 12605 different edge types:  the 5 most common are 119860, 119700,
119840, 119620 and 119460, of which none are self-loops and 297490 are
parallel. The graph is extremely dense as it has a density of 0.52549 and
is connected, as it has a single component. The graph median node degree
is 3563, the mean node degree is 4113.04 and the node degree mode is 2352.
The top 5 most central nodes are 1320 (degree 15599), 1391 (degree 14621),
1374 (degree 11409), 1148 (degree 10330) and 1362 (degree 10098).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import CopresenceLh10

    # Then load the graph
    graph = CopresenceLh10()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
