This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph cage14.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 20:37:02.655200

The undirected graph cage14 has 276696 nodes and 1483638 weighted edges,
of which 107406 are self-loops. The graph is extremely sparse as it has
a density of 0.00004 and is connected, as it has a single component. The
graph median node degree is 2, the mean node degree is 10.34, and the node
degree mode is 2. The top 5 most central nodes are 1457613 (degree 41),
1457612 (degree 41), 1457603 (degree 41), 1457602 (degree 41) and 1457443
(degree 41).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import Cage14

    # Then load the graph
    graph = Cage14()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
