This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph linux.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 11:16:50.670799

The undirected graph linux has 30837 nodes, of which 3 are singletons (all
have self-loops), and 213747 unweighted edges, of which 530 are self-loops.
The graph is quite sparse as it has a density of 0.00045 and has 12 connected
components, where the component with most nodes has 30817 nodes and the
component with the least nodes has a single node. The graph median node
degree is 7, the mean node degree is 13.85, and the node degree mode is
1. The top 5 most central nodes are 5 (degree 9339), 9 (degree 6924), 4
(degree 6735), 3 (degree 5796) and 67 (degree 4259).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import Linux

    # Then load the graph
    graph = Linux()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
