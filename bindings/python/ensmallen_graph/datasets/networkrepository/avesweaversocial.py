This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph aves-weaver-social.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-03 23:39:52.388294

The undirected multigraph aves-weaver-social has 445 nodes and 1336 unweighted
edges with 23 different edge types:  the 5 most common are 16, 3, 13, 8
and 11, of which 3 are self-loops and 2 are parallel. The graph is dense
as it has a density of 0.01350 and has 22 connected components, where the
component with most nodes has 117 nodes and the component with the least
nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 5, the mean node degree
is 6.00 and the node degree mode is 4. The top 5 most central nodes are
32 (degree 27), 236 (degree 23), 329 (degree 21), 270 (degree 21) and 240
(degree 21).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import AvesWeaverSocial

    # Then load the graph
    graph = AvesWeaverSocial()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
