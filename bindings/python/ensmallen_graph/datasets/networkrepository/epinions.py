This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph epinions.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-04 00:16:21.545310

The undirected graph epinions has 885388 nodes with 2 different node types:
2 (nodes number 755760) and 1 (nodes number 129628), of which 142 are singletons
(all have self-loops), and 14261449 unweighted edges, of which 538 are
self-loops. The graph is extremely sparse as it has a density of 0.00004
and has 1340 connected components, where the component with most nodes
has 882636 nodes and the component with the least nodes has a single node.
The graph median node degree is 8, the mean node degree is 32.21 and the
node degree mode is 2. The top 5 most central nodes are 32 (degree 162342),
22 (degree 55832), 628 (degree 47010), 36 (degree 43857) and 155 (degree
41067).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import Epinions

    # Then load the graph
    graph = Epinions()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
