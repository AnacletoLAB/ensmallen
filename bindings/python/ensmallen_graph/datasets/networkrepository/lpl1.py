This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph lpl1.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 11:17:00.687141

The undirected graph lpl1 has 32460 nodes, of which 1 are singletons (all
have self-loops), and 180248 unweighted edges, of which 32460 are self-loops.
The graph is quite sparse as it has a density of 0.00031 and has 3 connected
components, where the component with most nodes has 32279 nodes and the
component with the least nodes has a single node. The graph median node
degree is 7, the mean node degree is 10.11, and the node degree mode is
5. The top 5 most central nodes are 29474 (degree 253), 29469 (degree 145),
29127 (degree 118), 29123 (degree 118) and 28929 (degree 118).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import Lpl1

    # Then load the graph
    graph = Lpl1()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
