This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph as-caida.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 11:02:50.945348

The undirected graph as-caida has 26475 nodes and 53381 weighted edges,
of which none are self-loops. The graph is quite sparse as it has a density
of 0.00015 and is connected, as it has a single component. The graph median
node degree is 2, the mean node degree is 4.03, and the node degree mode
is 2. The top 5 most central nodes are 233 (degree 2628), 2562 (degree
2052), 107 (degree 1699), 330 (degree 1677) and 1041 (degree 1631).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import AsCaida

    # Then load the graph
    graph = AsCaida()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.

    Parameters
    -------------------
    directed: bool = False,
