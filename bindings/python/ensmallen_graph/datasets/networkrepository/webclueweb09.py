This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph web-ClueWeb09.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 19:19:43.776124

The undirected graph web-ClueWeb09 has 1684868322 nodes and 7811385827
unweighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is extremely
sparse as it has a density of 0.00000 and has 5642809 connected components,
where the component with most nodes has 1592230585 nodes and the component
with the least nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 1, the
mean node degree is 9.27, and the node degree mode is 1. The top 5 most
central nodes are 0 (degree 6444720), 2 (degree 6045226), 4 (degree 5104665),
1 (degree 4937883) and 9 (degree 4160186).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import WebClueweb09

    # Then load the graph
    graph = WebClueweb09()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
