This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph socfb-Caltech36.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 10:55:03.452858

The undirected graph socfb-Caltech36 has 769 nodes and 16656 unweighted
edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it has a density
of 0.05640 and has 4 connected components, where the component with most
nodes has 762 nodes and the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes.
The graph median node degree is 36, the mean node degree is 43.32, and
the node degree mode is 1. The top 5 most central nodes are 709 (degree
248), 90 (degree 203), 223 (degree 194), 664 (degree 184) and 257 (degree
172).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import SocfbCaltech36

    # Then load the graph
    graph = SocfbCaltech36()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
