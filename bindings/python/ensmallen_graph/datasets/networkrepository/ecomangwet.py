This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph eco-mangwet.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-03 23:59:07.818789

The undirected graph eco-mangwet has 97 nodes and 1446 weighted edges,
of which none are self-loops. The graph is quite dense as it has a density
of 0.31057 and is connected, as it has a single component. The graph median
node degree is 31, the mean node degree is 29.81 and the node degree mode
is 23. The top 5 most central nodes are 97 (degree 90), 92 (degree 74),
93 (degree 74), 57 (degree 58) and 55 (degree 55).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import EcoMangwet

    # Then load the graph
    graph = EcoMangwet()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
