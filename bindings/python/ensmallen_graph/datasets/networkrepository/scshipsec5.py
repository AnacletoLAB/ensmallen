"""
This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph sc-shipsec5.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 12:27:38.651808

The undirected graph sc-shipsec5 has 179104 nodes and 2200076 unweighted
edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is quite sparse as it has
a density of 0.00014 and has 36 connected components, where the component
with most nodes has 178573 nodes and the component with the least nodes
has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 23, the mean node degree is
24.57, and the node degree mode is 17. The top 5 most central nodes are
149328 (degree 75), 149286 (degree 75), 159060 (degree 73), 90967 (degree
73) and 11007 (degree 73).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import ScShipsec5

    # Then load the graph
    graph = ScShipsec5()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
