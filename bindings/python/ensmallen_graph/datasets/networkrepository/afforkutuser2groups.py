This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph aff-orkut-user2groups.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-04 09:21:12.482754

The undirected graph aff-orkut-user2groups has 8730857 nodes and 327036553
weighted edges, of which 67 are self-loops. The graph is extremely sparse
as it has a density of 0.00001 and is connected, as it has a single component.
The graph median node degree is 5, the mean node degree is 74.92, and the
node degree mode is 1. The top 5 most central nodes are 6637 (degree 318268),
7337 (degree 284411), 6748 (degree 221550), 7769 (degree 213405) and 7761
(degree 208320).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import AffOrkutUser2groups

    # Then load the graph
    graph = AffOrkutUser2groups()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
