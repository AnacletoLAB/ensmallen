This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph copresence-LyonSchool.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-03 23:43:01.274669

The undirected multigraph copresence-LyonSchool has 242 nodes and 6594492
unweighted edges with 3124 different edge types:  the 5 most common are
46560, 46640, 46580, 46600 and 46680, of which none are self-loops and
13135796 are parallel. The graph is extremely dense as it has a density
of 0.91197 and is connected, as it has a single component. The graph median
node degree is 55504, the mean node degree is 54499.93 and the node degree
mode is 28366. The top 5 most central nodes are 1695 (degree 97198), 1912
(degree 97035), 1675 (degree 96113), 1684 (degree 95074) and 1697 (degree
94706).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import CopresenceLyonschool

    # Then load the graph
    graph = CopresenceLyonschool()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
