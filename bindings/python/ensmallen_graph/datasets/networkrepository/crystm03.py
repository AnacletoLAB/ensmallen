This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph crystm03.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 11:08:13.844686

The undirected graph crystm03 has 24696 nodes and 304233 weighted edges,
of which 24696 are self-loops. The graph is quite sparse as it has a density
of 0.00096 and has 3 connected components, where the component with most
nodes has 8232 nodes and the component with the least nodes has 8232 nodes.
The graph median node degree is 27, the mean node degree is 23.64, and
the node degree mode is 27. The top 5 most central nodes are 24126 (degree
27), 24125 (degree 27), 24124 (degree 27), 24123 (degree 27) and 24122
(degree 27).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import Crystm03

    # Then load the graph
    graph = Crystm03()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
