This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph CL-1000000-2d1-trial1.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 12:24:31.335218

The undirected graph CL-1000000-2d1-trial1 has 910184 nodes and 2748347
unweighted edges, of which 22 are self-loops. The graph is extremely sparse
as it has a density of 0.00001 and has 3464 connected components, where
the component with most nodes has 902973 nodes and the component with the
least nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 3, the mean node
degree is 6.04, and the node degree mode is 2. The top 5 most central nodes
are 816747 (degree 226), 919530 (degree 226), 478129 (degree 223), 450355
(degree 222) and 933041 (degree 221).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import Cl10000002d1Trial1

    # Then load the graph
    graph = Cl10000002d1Trial1()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
