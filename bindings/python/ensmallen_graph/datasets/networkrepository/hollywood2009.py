This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph hollywood-2009.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 20:48:22.615802

The undirected graph hollywood-2009 has 83832 nodes, of which 32692 are
singletons (all have self-loops), and 549037 unweighted edges, of which
83831 are self-loops. The graph is quite sparse as it has a density of
0.00014 and has 44834 connected components, where the component with most
nodes has 11122 nodes and the component with the least nodes has a single
node. The graph median node degree is 2, the mean node degree is 12.10,
and the node degree mode is 1. The top 5 most central nodes are 1060694
(degree 1077), 1060699 (degree 1049), 1060702 (degree 979), 1060962 (degree
955) and 1060499 (degree 937).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import Hollywood2009

    # Then load the graph
    graph = Hollywood2009()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
