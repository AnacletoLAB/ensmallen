This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph san400-0-7-3.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 

Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-03 22:56:44.602941

The undirected graph san400-0-7-3 has 400 nodes and 55860 unweighted edges, of which
none are self-loops. The graph is extremely dense as it has a density of 0.70000
and is connected, as it has a single component. The graph median node degree is 280,
the mean node degree is 279.30 and the node degree mode is 284. The top 5 most central
nodes are 399 (degree 307), 116 (degree 305), 264 (degree 301), 304 (degree 300)
and 250 (degree 300).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import San400073

    # Then load the graph
    graph = San400073()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
