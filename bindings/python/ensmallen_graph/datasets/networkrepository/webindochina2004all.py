This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph web-indochina-2004-all.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-05 06:32:31.966361

The undirected graph web-indochina-2004-all has 7414768 nodes, of which
10 are singletons (all have self-loops), and 153487303 unweighted edges,
of which 2502484 are self-loops. The graph is extremely sparse as it has
a density of 0.00001 and has 197 connected components, where the component
with most nodes has 7320539 nodes and the component with the least nodes
has a single node. The graph median node degree is 11, the mean node degree
is 41.06, and the node degree mode is 1. The top 5 most central nodes are
7030320 (degree 256425), 7188998 (degree 179322), 7188997 (degree 178021),
7188996 (degree 176801) and 6968455 (degree 154370).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import WebIndochina2004All

    # Then load the graph
    graph = WebIndochina2004All()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
