"""
This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph sc-shipsec1.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 12:27:31.075101

The undirected graph sc-shipsec1 has 140385 nodes and 1707759 unweighted
edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is quite sparse as it has
a density of 0.00017 and has 3 connected components, where the component
with most nodes has 139995 nodes and the component with the least nodes
has 195 nodes. The graph median node degree is 23, the mean node degree
is 24.33, and the node degree mode is 20. The top 5 most central nodes
are 135844 (degree 67), 135843 (degree 67), 134756 (degree 67), 134755
(degree 67) and 128905 (degree 67).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import ScShipsec1

    # Then load the graph
    graph = ScShipsec1()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
