This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph gent113.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 

Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 08:12:21.671539

The undirected graph gent113 has 113 nodes, of which 9 are singletons (all have self-loops),
and 639 unweighted edges, of which 90 are self-loops. The graph is dense as it has
a density of 0.09387 and has 10 connected components, where the component with most
nodes has 104 nodes and the component with the least nodes has a single node. The
graph median node degree is 11, the mean node degree is 10.51, and the node degree
mode is 6. The top 5 most central nodes are 15 (degree 27), 14 (degree 27), 30 (degree
23), 29 (degree 23) and 23 (degree 21).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import Gent113

    # Then load the graph
    graph = Gent113()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
