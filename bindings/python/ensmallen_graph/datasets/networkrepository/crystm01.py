This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph crystm01.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 10:20:41.080012

The undirected graph crystm01 has 4875 nodes and 55107 weighted edges,
of which 4875 are self-loops. The graph is sparse as it has a density of
0.00443 and has 3 connected components, where the component with most nodes
has 1625 nodes and the component with the least nodes has 1625 nodes. The
graph median node degree is 18, the mean node degree is 21.61, and the
node degree mode is 27. The top 5 most central nodes are 4638 (degree 27),
4637 (degree 27), 4636 (degree 27), 4635 (degree 27) and 4634 (degree 27).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import Crystm01

    # Then load the graph
    graph = Crystm01()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
