This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph ER-MD.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-04 09:06:53.999659

The undirected graph ER-MD has 9512 nodes with 10 different node types:
 the 5 most common are 1 (nodes number 8013), 2 (nodes number 1075), 4
(nodes number 175), 3 (nodes number 171) and 6 (nodes number 31) and 104741
unweighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is sparse as
it has a density of 0.00232 and has 446 connected components, where the
component with most nodes has 43 nodes and the component with the least
nodes has 4 nodes. The graph median node degree is 21, the mean node degree
is 22.02 and the node degree mode is 22. The top 5 most central nodes are
5588 (degree 42), 5587 (degree 42), 5586 (degree 42), 5585 (degree 42)
and 5584 (degree 42).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import ErMd

    # Then load the graph
    graph = ErMd()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
