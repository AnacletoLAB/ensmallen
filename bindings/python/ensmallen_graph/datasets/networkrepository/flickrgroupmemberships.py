This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph flickr-groupmemberships.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 

Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 12:10:06.527593

The undirected graph flickr-groupmemberships has 395979 nodes and 8537817
unweighted edges, of which 114 are self-loops. The graph is quite sparse
as it has a density of 0.00011 and is connected, as it has a single component.
The graph median node degree is 4, the mean node degree is 43.12, and the
node degree mode is 1. The top 5 most central nodes are 41 (degree 34990),
13 (degree 30312), 48 (degree 27796), 23 (degree 22117) and 8 (degree 21884).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import FlickrGroupmemberships

    # Then load the graph
    graph = FlickrGroupmemberships()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
