This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph copresence-Thiers13.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-03 23:46:39.039300

The undirected multigraph copresence-Thiers13 has 328 nodes and 18613039
unweighted edges with 8938 different edge types:  the 5 most common are
215180, 215160, 214800, 213220 and 214760, of which none are self-loops
and 37139086 are parallel. The graph is extremely dense as it has a density
of 0.81107 and is connected, as it has a single component. The graph median
node degree is 118543, the mean node degree is 113494.14 and the node degree
mode is 72694. The top 5 most central nodes are 170 (degree 195938), 275
(degree 195137), 447 (degree 188712), 285 (degree 183239) and 939 (degree
181945).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import CopresenceThiers13

    # Then load the graph
    graph = CopresenceThiers13()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
