This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph SFHH-conf-sensor.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-03 23:35:03.981918

The undirected multigraph SFHH-conf-sensor has 403 nodes and 70261 unweighted
edges with 3509 different edge types:  the 5 most common are 41320, 41280,
41240, 60860 and 41300, of which none are self-loops and 121392 are parallel.
The graph is quite dense as it has a density of 0.11808 and is connected,
as it has a single component. The graph median node degree is 220, the
mean node degree is 348.69 and the node degree mode is 189. The top 5 most
central nodes are 1825 (degree 2446), 1525 (degree 2241), 1549 (degree
2189), 1599 (degree 2112) and 1441 (degree 1994).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import SfhhConfSensor

    # Then load the graph
    graph = SfhhConfSensor()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
