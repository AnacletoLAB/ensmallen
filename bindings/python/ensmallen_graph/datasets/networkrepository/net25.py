This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph net25.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 11:23:43.855694

The undirected graph net25 has 9520 nodes and 205360 unweighted edges,
of which 9520 are self-loops. The graph is sparse as it has a density of
0.00443 and has 2 connected components, where the component with most nodes
has 7684 nodes and the component with the least nodes has 1836 nodes. The
graph median node degree is 31, the mean node degree is 42.14, and the
node degree mode is 31. The top 5 most central nodes are 8485 (degree 139),
8484 (degree 139), 8483 (degree 139), 8482 (degree 139) and 8481 (degree
139).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import Net25

    # Then load the graph
    graph = Net25()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
