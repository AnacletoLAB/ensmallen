This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Kohonen.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 10:13:50.920204

The undirected graph Kohonen has 3772 nodes and 12720 unweighted edges,
of which 2 are self-loops. The graph is sparse as it has a density of 0.00179
and has 27 connected components, where the component with most nodes has
3704 nodes and the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes. The graph
median node degree is 4, the mean node degree is 6.74, and the node degree
mode is 1. The top 5 most central nodes are 122 (degree 740), 108 (degree
540), 842 (degree 478), 450 (degree 203) and 312 (degree 188).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import Kohonen

    # Then load the graph
    graph = Kohonen()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.

    Parameters
    -------------------
    directed: bool = False,
