This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph cond-mat-2003.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 11:07:50.819914

The undirected graph cond-mat-2003 has 30460 nodes and 120029 weighted
edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is quite sparse as it has
a density of 0.00026 and has 896 connected components, where the component
with most nodes has 27519 nodes and the component with the least nodes
has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 5, the mean node degree is
7.88, and the node degree mode is 2. The top 5 most central nodes are 1886
(degree 202), 1887 (degree 195), 131 (degree 193), 381 (degree 182) and
2023 (degree 176).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import CondMat2003

    # Then load the graph
    graph = CondMat2003()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
