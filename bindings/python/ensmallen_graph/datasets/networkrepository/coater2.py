This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph coater2.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 11:07:42.158441

The undirected graph coater2 has 9540 nodes and 145819 weighted edges,
of which 340 are self-loops. The graph is sparse as it has a density of
0.00320 and is connected, as it has a single component. The graph median
node degree is 29, the mean node degree is 30.53, and the node degree mode
is 34. The top 5 most central nodes are 8375 (degree 65), 8376 (degree
65), 8262 (degree 65), 8452 (degree 64) and 8471 (degree 64).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import Coater2

    # Then load the graph
    graph = Coater2()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
