This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph primary-school-proximity.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 11:37:41.721769

The undirected multigraph primary-school-proximity has 242 nodes and 125773
unweighted edges with 3100 different edge types:  the 5 most common are
38900, 144520, 38520, 38460 and 39040, of which none are self-loops and
234912 are parallel. The graph is quite dense as it has a density of 0.28521
and is connected, as it has a single component. The graph median node degree
is 1000, the mean node degree is 1039.45, and the node degree mode is 1033.
The top 5 most central nodes are 1695 (degree 2594), 1697 (degree 2532),
1665 (degree 2447), 1698 (degree 2442) and 1613 (degree 2249).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import PrimarySchoolProximity

    # Then load the graph
    graph = PrimarySchoolProximity()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
