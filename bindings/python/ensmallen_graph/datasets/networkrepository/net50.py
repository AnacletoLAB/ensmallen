This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph net50.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 11:23:48.920067

The undirected graph net50 has 16320 nodes and 480760 unweighted edges,
of which 16320 are self-loops. The graph is sparse as it has a density
of 0.00355 and has 2 connected components, where the component with most
nodes has 14484 nodes and the component with the least nodes has 1836 nodes.
The graph median node degree is 69, the mean node degree is 57.92, and
the node degree mode is 69. The top 5 most central nodes are 13560 (degree
139), 13559 (degree 139), 13558 (degree 139), 13557 (degree 139) and 13556
(degree 139).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import Net50

    # Then load the graph
    graph = Net50()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
