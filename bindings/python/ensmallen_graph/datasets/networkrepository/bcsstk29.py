This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph bcsstk29.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 11:03:11.100671

The undirected graph bcsstk29 has 13992 nodes and 316740 unweighted edges,
of which 13992 are self-loops. The graph is sparse as it has a density
of 0.00316 and has 28 connected components, where the component with most
nodes has 13830 nodes and the component with the least nodes has 6 nodes.
The graph median node degree is 51, the mean node degree is 44.27, and
the node degree mode is 54. The top 5 most central nodes are 12333 (degree
71), 11085 (degree 70), 2445 (degree 70), 12336 (degree 69) and 12335 (degree
69).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import Bcsstk29

    # Then load the graph
    graph = Bcsstk29()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
