This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph CL-100000-1d8-trial1.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 11:37:54.096013

The undirected graph CL-100000-1d8-trial1 has 92482 nodes and 436611 unweighted
edges, of which 14 are self-loops. The graph is quite sparse as it has
a density of 0.00010 and has 148 connected components, where the component
with most nodes has 92183 nodes and the component with the least nodes
has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 3, the mean node degree is
9.44, and the node degree mode is 2. The top 5 most central nodes are 53325
(degree 230), 12899 (degree 226), 24155 (degree 220), 66377 (degree 219)
and 41847 (degree 216).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import Cl1000001d8Trial1

    # Then load the graph
    graph = Cl1000001d8Trial1()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
