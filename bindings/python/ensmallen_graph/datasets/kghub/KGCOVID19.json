The graph is quite sparse as it has a density of 0.00018 and has 9976 connected components, where the component with most nodes has 431964 nodes and the component with the least nodes has a single node. The graph median node degree is 9, the mean node degree is 80.67, and the node degree mode is 1. The top 5 most central nodes are MESH:D014780 (degree 122238), MESH:D006801 (degree 104307), MESH:D018352 (degree 92928), WD:Q30 (degree 92141) and NCBITaxon:2697049 (degree 91006).", "graph_json_report": {"unique_node_types_number": "44", "min_degree": "0", "max_degree": "122238", "has_weights": "false", "nodes_number": "444887", "name": "KGCOVID19", "self_loops_rate": "0.000014043886364673696", "has_edge_types": "true", "directed": "false", "self_loops_number": "504", "singletons": "9256", "unique_edge_types_number": "34", "has_node_types": "true", "edges_number": "35887502", "degree_mean": "80.66655577708497", "density": "0.00018130528750247144", "undirected_edges_number": "17944003"}, "citations": ["@article{reese2021kg,\n  title={KG-COVID-19: a framework to produce customized knowledge graphs for COVID-19 response},\n  author={Reese, Justin T and Unni, Deepak and Callahan, Tiffany J and Cappelletti, Luca and Ravanmehr, Vida and Carbon, Seth and Shefchek, Kent A and Good, Benjamin M and Balhoff, James P and Fontana, Tommaso and others},\n  journal={Patterns},\n  volume={2},\n  number={1},\n  pages={100155},\n  year={2021},\n  publisher={Elsevier}\n}"], "urls": ["https://kg-hub.berkeleybop.io/kg-covid-19/current/kg-covid-19.tar.gz"], "paths": ["kghub/kg-covid-19.tar.gz"], "datetime": "2021-02-12 11:10:25.244690", "arguments": {"edge_list_comment_symbol": null, "default_node_type": "biolink:NamedThing", "name": "KGCOVID19", "edge_path": "kghub/kg-covid-19/merged-kg_edges.tsv", "sources_column": "subject", "edge_list_separator": "\t", "node_list_separator": "\t", "node_types_separator": "|", "node_list_node_types_column": "category", "node_path": "kghub/kg-covid-19/merged-kg_nodes.tsv", "node_list_comment_symbol": null, "directed": false, "edge_list_rows_to_skip": 0, "destinations_column": "object", "edge_list_edge_types_column": "predicate", "nodes_column": "id"}}
