This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph STRING.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the KGHub repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-12 11:08:07.374561

The undirected graph STRING has 37019 nodes with 2 different node types:
biolink:Protein (nodes number 19354) and biolink:Gene (nodes number 17665)
and 5897392 unweighted edges with 2 different edge types: biolink:interacts_with
and biolink:has_gene_product, of which none are self-loops. The graph is
sparse as it has a density of 0.00861 and is connected, as it has a single
component. The graph median node degree is 62, the mean node degree is
318.61, and the node degree mode is 1. The top 5 most central nodes are
ENSEMBL:ENSP00000229239 (degree 7646), ENSEMBL:ENSP00000451828 (degree
6508), ENSEMBL:ENSP00000269305 (degree 6197), ENSEMBL:ENSP00000380432 (degree
6055) and ENSEMBL:ENSP00000479618 (degree 5787).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.kghub import STRING

    # Then load the graph
    graph = STRING()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
