"""
This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph PharmGKB.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the KGHub repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-12 11:08:11.597088

The undirected graph PharmGKB has 2453 nodes with 2 different node types:
biolink:Gene (nodes number 1326) and biolink:Drug (nodes number 1127) and
5720 unweighted edges with a single edge type: biolink:interacts_with,
of which none are self-loops. The graph is sparse as it has a density of
0.00190 and has 35 connected components, where the component with most
nodes has 2370 nodes and the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes.
The graph median node degree is 2, the mean node degree is 4.66, and the
node degree mode is 1. The top 5 most central nodes are UniProtKB:P08183
(degree 218), UniProtKB:Q6GRK0 (degree 180), UniProtKB:Q6NXU8 (degree 178),
UniProtKB:P33261 (degree 119) and UniProtKB:P20815 (degree 107).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.kghub import PharmGKB

    # Then load the graph
    graph = PharmGKB()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
