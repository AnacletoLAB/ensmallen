This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph IntAct.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the KGHub repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-12 11:08:10.432483

The undirected graph IntAct has 3058 nodes with 4 different node types:
biolink:Protein (nodes number 2945), biolink:Drug (nodes number 82), biolink:RNA
(nodes number 28) and biolink:MolecularEntity (nodes number 3), of which
2265 are singletons (2 of these have self-loops), and 1167 unweighted edges
with a single edge type: biolink:interacts_with, of which 35 are self-loops.
The graph is quite sparse as it has a density of 0.00025 and has 2310 connected
components, where the component with most nodes has 603 nodes and the component
with the least nodes has a single node. The graph median node degree is
0, the mean node degree is 0.75, and the node degree mode is 0. The top
5 most central nodes are UniProtKB:P0DTC2 (degree 59), UniProtKB:Q14160
(degree 53), UniProtKB:Q12959 (degree 53), UniProtKB:P0C6X7-PRO_0000037311
(degree 34) and UniProtKB:Q9BYF1 (degree 31).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.kghub import IntAct

    # Then load the graph
    graph = IntAct()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
