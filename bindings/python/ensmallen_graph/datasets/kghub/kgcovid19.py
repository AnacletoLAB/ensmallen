This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph KGCOVID19.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the KGHub repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-12 11:10:25.244690

The undirected multigraph KGCOVID19 has 444887 nodes with 44 different
node types:  the 5 most common are biolink:Publication (nodes number 190048),
biolink:OntologyClass (nodes number 52013), biolink:Drug (nodes number
36151), biolink:Disease (nodes number 24409) and biolink:BiologicalProcess
(nodes number 23310), of which 9256 are singletons (41 of these have self-loops),
and 17944003 unweighted edges with 34 different edge types:  the 5 most
common are biolink:related_to, biolink:interacts_with, biolink:subclass_of,
biolink:part_of and biolink:enables, of which 504 are self-loops and 2754
are parallel. The graph is quite sparse as it has a density of 0.00018
and has 9976 connected components, where the component with most nodes
has 431964 nodes and the component with the least nodes has a single node.
The graph median node degree is 9, the mean node degree is 80.67, and the
node degree mode is 1. The top 5 most central nodes are MESH:D014780 (degree
122238), MESH:D006801 (degree 104307), MESH:D018352 (degree 92928), WD:Q30
(degree 92141) and NCBITaxon:2697049 (degree 91006).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.kghub import KGCOVID19

    # Then load the graph
    graph = KGCOVID19()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
