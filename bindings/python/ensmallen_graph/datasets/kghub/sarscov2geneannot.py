This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph SARSCOV2GeneAnnot.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the KGHub repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-12 11:08:13.317930

The undirected graph SARSCOV2GeneAnnot has 2528 nodes with 2 different
node types: biolink:Protein (nodes number 2403) and biolink:OntologyClass
(nodes number 125), of which 6 are singletons, and 46150 unweighted edges
with 3 different edge types: biolink:enables, biolink:involved_in and biolink:part_of,
of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it has a density of
0.01445 and has 7 connected components, where the component with most nodes
has 2522 nodes and the component with the least nodes has a single node.
The graph median node degree is 13, the mean node degree is 36.51, and
the node degree mode is 1. The top 5 most central nodes are GO:0016020
(degree 1411), GO:0016021 (degree 1381), GO:0033644 (degree 1305), GO:0016032
(degree 1148) and GO:0003723 (degree 1048).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.kghub import SARSCOV2GeneAnnot

    # Then load the graph
    graph = SARSCOV2GeneAnnot()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
