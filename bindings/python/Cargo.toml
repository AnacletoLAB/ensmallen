# The opt-level setting controls the number of optimizations Rust will apply to 
# your code, with a range of 0 to 3. Applying more optimizations extends 
# compiling time, so if you’re in development and compiling your code often, 
# you’ll want faster compiling even if the resulting code runs slower. That is 
# the reason the default opt-level for dev is 0. When you’re ready to release 
# your code, it’s best to spend more time compiling. You’ll only compile in 
# release mode once, but you’ll run the compiled program many times, so release 
# mode trades longer compile time for code that runs faster. That is why the 
# default opt-level for the release profile is 3.
opt-level = 3

# This flag controls whether LLVM uses link time optimizations to produce better 
# optimized code, using whole-program analysis, at the cost of longer linking 
# time.
# Perform "fat" LTO which attempts to perform optimizations across all crates 
# within the dependency graph
lto = "fat"

# When a crate is split into multiple codegen units, LLVM is able to process 
# them in parallel. Increasing parallelism may speed up compile times, but may 
# also produce slower code. Setting this to 1 may improve the performance of 
# generated code, but may be slower to compile.
# The default value, if not specified, is 16 for non-incremental builds. For 
# incremental builds the default is 256 which allows caching to be more 
# granular.
# codgen-units=1

# This option lets you set the default threshold for inlining a function. 
# It takes an unsigned integer as a value. Inlining is based on a cost model, 
# where a higher threshold will allow more inlining.
# The default for opt-level=3 is 275.
#inline-threshold=1000000
