message,When the smallest component is one the graph must have singletons! Graph report: 
Ok("The undirected multigraph Fuzz Graph has 4 nodes and 4 weighted edges with 4 different edge types: QQQQQQQQQQQQQQ], QQQQQQQQQQQQQQQ, \u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{8}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f} and \u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}, of which 2 are self-loops and 1 are parallel. The graph is quite dense as it has a density of 0.31250 and has 2 connected components, where the component with most nodes has 3 nodes and the component with the least nodes has a single node. The graph median node degree is 1, the mean node degree is 1.50, and the node degree mode is 1. The top 4 most central nodes are \u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f}\u{f} (degree 3), \u{f}QQQQQQQQQQQQQQ (degree 1), Q-7363920QQQQQQ (degree 1) and QQQQQQQQQQQQQQQ (degree 1). The hash of the graph is acd1851d379448d.")
