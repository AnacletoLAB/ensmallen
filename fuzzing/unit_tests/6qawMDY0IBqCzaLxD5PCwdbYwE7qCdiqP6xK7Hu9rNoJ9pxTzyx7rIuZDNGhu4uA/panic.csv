message,In an undirected graph, for every edge there must have its own symmetric edge.
In the provided graph instance, for the edge from the source node ID 0 to the destination node ID 1 the symmetric edge does not exist.
This error is likely caused by some mis-parametrization in a method that is expected to produce a simmetric graph.
The complete set of edges in the graph is:
[[0, 1], [2, 1], [3, 1]]
