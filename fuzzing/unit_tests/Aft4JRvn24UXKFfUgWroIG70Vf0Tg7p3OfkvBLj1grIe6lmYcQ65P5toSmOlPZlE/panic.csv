  left: `9`,
 right: `8`: We expected the connected components to be a dense set.
 The obtained components are: 
[7, 7, 7, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 7, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9, 5, 5, 6, 6]

Ok("The undirected graph Fuzz Graph has 42 nodes and 38 weighted edges, of which 5 are self-loops. The graph is dense as it has a density of 0.04025 and has 9 connected components, where the component with most nodes has 13 nodes and the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 1, the mean node degree is 1.69, and the node degree mode is 1.
