The directed graph  has 2 nodes with a single node type:  (nodes number 1) and 1 weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is extremely dense as it has a density of 0.50000 and is connected, as it has a single component. The graph median node degree is 1, the mean node degree is 0.50, and the node degree mode is 0. The top 2 most central nodes are  (degree 1) and  (degree 0). The hash of the graph is 506f850c8846163f.
