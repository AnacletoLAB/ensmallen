<h2>MetaTest</h2>The undirected graph MetaTest has 2 nodes and 2 homogeneous edges.<br><h3>Degree centrality</h3>The minimum node degree is 1, the maximum node degree is 2, the mode degree is 1, the mean degree is 1.50 and the node degree median is 2.<br>The nodes with highest degree centrality are: DEUS.<br><h3>Weights</h3>The minimum edge weight is 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001, the maximum edge weight is 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 and the total edge weight is 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000023694281078769324.<br><h4>Weighted degree centrality</h4>The minimum node degree is 0.00, the maximum node degree is 0.00, the mean degree is 0.00 and the node degree median is 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000002369427967747086.<br>The nodes with highest degree centrality are: DESU.<br><h3>Edge types</h3>The graph has a single edge type, which is . Note that this means that all edges have the same edge type, that is, all edges are homogeneous..<br>
