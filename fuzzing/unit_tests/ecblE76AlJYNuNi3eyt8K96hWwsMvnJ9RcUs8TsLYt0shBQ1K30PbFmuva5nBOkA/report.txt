The undirected multigraph Fuzz Graph has 3 nodes and 3 weighted edges with 3 different edge types: 20QQQQQQQQQQQQQ,  and , of which 2 are self-loops and 1 are parallel. The graph is quite dense as it has a density of 0.33333 and has 2 connected components, where the component with most nodes has 2 nodes and the component with the least nodes has a single node. The graph median node degree is 1, the mean node degree is 1.33, and the node degree mode is 1. The top 3 most central nodes are  (degree 2), QQQQQQQQQQ-7363 (degree 1) and QQQQQQQQQ (degree 1). The hash of the graph is d43c30bf0ef5bd21.
