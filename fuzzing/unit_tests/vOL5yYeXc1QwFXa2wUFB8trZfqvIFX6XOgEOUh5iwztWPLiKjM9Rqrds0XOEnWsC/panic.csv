message,The path from source to destination has distance 56188276737.49412 while the distance from destination to source has destination 56188276737.49411. The path from source to destination is [2, 1, 0, 4], while the path from destination to source is [4, 0, 1, 2]. The two paths should be symmetric and with the same distance.
The graph report is:
Ok("The undirected graph Fuzz Graph has 7 nodes and 6 weighted edges, of which 1 are self-loops. The graph is quite dense as it has a density of 0.22449 and has 2 connected components, where the component with most nodes has 5 nodes and the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 1, the mean node degree is 1.57, and the node degree mode is 1. The top 5 most central nodes are ????? (degree 4), ????\u{5} (degree 2), \u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0} (degree 1), QQQ?\u{1} (degree 1) and \u{5}\u{5}\u{5}\u{5}\u{0} (degree 1). The hash of the graph is 84ed61c10a6b47c9.")
