The directed graph MetaTest has 2 nodes There are 2 singleton nodes, and 0 unweighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is extremely sparse as it has a density of 0.00000 and has 2 connected components, where the component with most nodes has a single node and the component with the least nodes has a single node. The graph median node degree is 0, the mean node degree is 0.00, and the node degree mode is 0. The top 2 most central nodes are 55555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555u55555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555 (degree 0) and e (degree 0). The hash of the graph is 47e9fb5b6bd529a0.
