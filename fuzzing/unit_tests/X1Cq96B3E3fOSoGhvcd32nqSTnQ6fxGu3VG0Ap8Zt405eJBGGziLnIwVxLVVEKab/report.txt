<h2>MetaTest</h2>The undirected graph MetaTest has a single node called  (degree 1 and weighted degree 1) and a single edge between "\u{7} (degree 1 and weighted degree 1)" and "\u{7} (degree 1 and weighted degree 1)" with edge type .<br><h3>Degree centrality</h3>The minimum node degree is 1, the maximum node degree is 1, the mode degree is 1, the mean degree is 1.00 and the node degree median is 1.<br>The nodes with highest degree centrality are: DEUS.<br><h3>Disconnected nodes</h3>Disconnected nodes are nodes that are not connected to any other node.<br>The graph contains 1 disconnected nodes.<br><h4>Singleton nodes with selfloops</h4>Singleton nodes with selfloops are nodes with no edge to other nodes and have exclusively selfloops.<br>The graph contains a singleton node with selfloop, which is  (degree 1 and weighted degree 1).<br><h3>Weights</h3>The minimum edge weight is 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000050727198, the maximum edge weight is 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000050727198 and the total edge weight is 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000050727198124058086.<br><h4>Weighted degree centrality</h4>The minimum node degree is 0.00, the maximum node degree is 0.00, the mean degree is 0.00 and the node degree median is 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000050727198124058086.<br>The nodes with highest degree centrality are: DESU.<br><h3>Edge types</h3>The graph has a single edge type, which is . Note that this means that all edges have the same edge type, that is, all edges are homogeneous..<br><h4>Singleton edge types</h4>Singleton edge types are edge types that are assigned exclusively to a single edge, making the edge type relatively meaningless, as it adds no more information then the name of edge itself.<br>The graph contains a edge with singleton edge type, which is .
