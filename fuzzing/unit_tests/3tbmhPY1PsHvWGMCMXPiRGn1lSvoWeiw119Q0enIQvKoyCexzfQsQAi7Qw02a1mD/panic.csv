message,The path from source to destination has distance 0.000000000000000000000000000000000008992393313081449 while the distance from destination to source has destination 0.7470588088035583. The path from source to destination is [0, 1], while the path from destination to source is [1, 0]. The two paths should be symmetric and with the same distance.
The graph report is:
Ok("The undirected graph Fuzz Graph has 3 nodes and 3 weighted edges, of which 2 are self-loops. The graph is quite dense as it has a density of 0.44444 and has 2 connected components, where the component with most nodes has 2 nodes and the component with the least nodes has a single node. The graph median node degree is 1, the mean node degree is 1.33, and the node degree mode is 1. The top 3 most central nodes are ????? (degree 2), \u{5}\u{5}\u{5}\u{5}\u{5} (degree 1) and ????\u{5} (degree 1). The hash of the graph is d8eae2eb500f16a.")
