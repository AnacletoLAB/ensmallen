<h2>MetaTest</h2>The undirected graph MetaTest has 5 nodes and 3 homogeneous edges.<br><h3>Degree centrality</h3>The minimum node degree is 1, the maximum node degree is 2, the mode degree is 1, the mean degree is 1.20 and the node degree median is 1.<br>The nodes with highest degree centrality are: DEUS.<br><h3>Edge types</h3>The graph has a single edge type, which is 33333333333333333. Note that this means that all edges have the same edge type, that is, all edges are homogeneous..<br><h4>Unknown edge types</h4>Edges with unknown edge types are edges with a edge type that was not provided during the creation of the graph, which may be desired as the output of a edge-label holdout.<br>The graph contains 4 edges with unknown edge type, which are edge between "33333333333 (degree 1)" and "3333 (degree 2)" with unknown edge type, edge between "3333 (degree 2)" and "33333333333 (degree 1)" with unknown edge type, edge between "333333333 (degree 1)" and "333333 (degree 1)" with unknown edge type and edge between "333333 (degree 1)" and "333333333 (degree 1)" with unknown edge type.<br>, making up 66.67 of the edges.<br>
