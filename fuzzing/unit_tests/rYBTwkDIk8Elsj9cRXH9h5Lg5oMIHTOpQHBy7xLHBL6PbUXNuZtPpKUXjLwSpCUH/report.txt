<h2>MetaTest</h2>The directed graph MetaTest has 4 nodes and 2 homogeneous edges.<br><h3>Degree centrality</h3>The minimum node degree is 0, the maximum node degree is 1, the mode degree is 0, the mean degree is 0.50 and the node degree median is 1.<br>The nodes with highest degree centrality are: DEUS.<br><h3>Edge types</h3>The graph has a single edge type, which is CCCCCCC. Note that this means that all edges have the same edge type, that is, all edges are homogeneous..<br><h4>Singleton edge types</h4>Singleton edge types are edge types that are assigned exclusively to a single edge, making the edge type relatively meaningless, as it adds no more information then the name of edge itself.<br>The graph contains a edge with singleton edge type, which is CCCCCCC.<h4>Unknown edge types</h4>Edges with unknown edge types are edges with a edge type that was not provided during the creation of the graph, which may be desired as the output of a edge-label holdout.<br>The graph contains a edge with unknown edge type, which is edge between "CCCCCCCCCC\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0} (degree 1)" and "\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\u{0}\t" with unknown edge type., making up 50.00 of the edges.<br>
