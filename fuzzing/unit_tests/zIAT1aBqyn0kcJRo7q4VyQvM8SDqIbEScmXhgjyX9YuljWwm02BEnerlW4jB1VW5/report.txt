<h2>MetaTest</h2>The undirected graph MetaTest has 3 nodes and 2 heterogenous edges.<br><h3>Degree centrality</h3>The minimum node degree is 1, the maximum node degree is 1, the mode degree is 1, the mean degree is 1.00 and the node degree median is 1.<br>The nodes with highest degree centrality are: /////////////////////////////////////////////// (degree 1 and weighted degree 1), /////////////////////////////^///////////////// (degree 1 and weighted degree 1) and ////////////// (degree 1 and weighted degree 1).<br><h3>Disconnected nodes</h3>Disconnected nodes are nodes that are not connected to any other node.<br>The graph contains 1 disconnected nodes.<br><h4>Singleton nodes with selfloops</h4>Singleton nodes with selfloops are nodes with no edge to other nodes and have exclusively selfloops.<br>The graph contains a singleton node with selfloop, which is /////////////////////////////////////////////// (degree 1 and weighted degree 1).<br><h3>Weights</h3><br><p>The minimum edge weight is 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000016926, the maximum edge weight is 0.0000000001593292 and the total edge weight is 0.00000000015932920260919303.</p><br><h4>Weighted degree centrality</h4><p>The minimum node degree is 0.00, the maximum node degree is 0.00, the mean degree is 0.00 and the node degree median is 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000016926284150579465.</p><br><p>The nodes with highest degree centrality are: /////////////////////////////////////////////// (degree 1 and weighted degree 1), /////////////////////////////^///////////////// (degree 1 and weighted degree 1) and ////////////// (degree 1 and weighted degree 1).</p><br><h3>Edge types</h3>The graph has 2 edge types, which are ///////////// (2 edges, 66.67%) and /////////////////////////////////////////////// (1 edges, 33.33%).<br><h4>Singleton edge types</h4>Singleton edge types are edge types that are assigned exclusively to a single edge, making the edge type relatively meaningless, as it adds no more information then the name of edge itself.<br>The graph contains a edge with singleton edge type, which is ///////////////////////////////////////////////.
