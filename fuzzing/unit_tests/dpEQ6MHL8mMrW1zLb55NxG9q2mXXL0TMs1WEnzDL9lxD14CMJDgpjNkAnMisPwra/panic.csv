message,The path from source to destination has distance 14456878171947010 while the distance from destination to source has destination 14456878171947008. The path from source to destination is [0, 1, 2, 3], while the path from destination to source is [3, 2, 1, 0]. The two paths should be symmetric and with the same distance.
The graph report is:
