<h2>MetaTest</h2>The undirected graph MetaTest has 2 nodes and 2 homogeneous edges.<br><h3>Degree centrality</h3>The minimum node degree is 1, the maximum node degree is 2, the mode degree is 1, the mean degree is 1.50 and the node degree median is 2.<br>The nodes with highest degree centrality are: DEUS.<br><h3>Edge types</h3>The graph has a single edge type, which is . Note that this means that all edges have the same edge type, that is, all edges are homogeneous..<br>
