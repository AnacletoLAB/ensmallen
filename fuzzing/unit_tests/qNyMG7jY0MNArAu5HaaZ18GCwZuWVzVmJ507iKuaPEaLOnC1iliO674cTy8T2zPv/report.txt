The directed multigraph MetaTest has 2 nodes and 4 weighted edges with a single edge type: Õ˜, of which 3 are self-loops and 2 are parallel. The graph is extremely dense as it has a density of 0.50000 and is connected, as it has a single component. The graph median node degree is 3, the mean node degree is 2.00, and the node degree mode is 3. The top 2 most central nodes are  (degree 3) and  (degree 1). The hash of the graph is 7a32bf53a95fc1d2.
