The undirected graph Fuzz Graph has 4 nodes and 2 weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is quite dense as it has a density of 0.33333 and has 2 connected components, where the component with most nodes has 2 nodes and the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 1, the mean node degree is 1.00, and the node degree mode is 1. The top 4 most central nodes are  (degree 1), 	 (degree 1),  (degree 1) and 242033 (degree 1).
