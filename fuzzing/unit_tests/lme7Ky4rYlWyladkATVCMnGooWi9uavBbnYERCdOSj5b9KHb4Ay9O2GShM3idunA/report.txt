The undirected multigraph MetaTest has 14 nodes There are 14 singleton nodes (2 of these have self-loops), and 3 weighted edges, of which 3 are self-loops and 1 are parallel. The graph is dense as it has a density of 0.01020 and has 14 connected components, where the component with most nodes has a single node and the component with the least nodes has a single node. The graph median node degree is 0, the mean node degree is 0.21, and the node degree mode is 0.
