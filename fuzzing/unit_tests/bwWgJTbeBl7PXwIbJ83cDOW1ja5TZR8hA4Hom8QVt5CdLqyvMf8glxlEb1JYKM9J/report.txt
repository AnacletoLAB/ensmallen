<h2>MetaTest</h2>The undirected graph MetaTest has 3 nodes and 2 homogeneous edges.<br><h3>Degree centrality</h3>The minimum node degree is 1, the maximum node degree is 1, the mode degree is 1, the mean degree is 1.00 and the node degree median is 1.<br>The nodes with highest degree centrality are: DEUS.<br><h3>Disconnected nodes</h3>Disconnected nodes are nodes that are not connected to any other node.<br>The graph contains 1 disconnected nodes.<br><h4>Singleton nodes with selfloops</h4>Singleton nodes with selfloops are nodes with no edge to other nodes and have exclusively selfloops.<br>The graph contains a singleton node with selfloop, which is  (degree 1 and weighted degree 1).<br><h3>Weights</h3>The minimum edge weight is 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000023694278, the maximum edge weight is 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000023694278 and the total edge weight is 1762092466223630000000000000.<br><h4>Weighted degree centrality</h4>The minimum node degree is 0.00, the maximum node degree is 881046233111815004977364992.00, the mean degree is 587364155407876692891402240.00 and the node degree median is 881046233111815000000000000.<br>The nodes with highest degree centrality are: DESU.<br><h3>Edge types</h3>The graph has a single edge type, which is . Note that this means that all edges have the same edge type, that is, all edges are homogeneous..<br><h4>Singleton edge types</h4>Singleton edge types are edge types that are assigned exclusively to a single edge, making the edge type relatively meaningless, as it adds no more information then the name of edge itself.<br>The graph contains a edge with singleton edge type, which is .<h4>Unknown edge types</h4>Edges with unknown edge types are edges with a edge type that was not provided during the creation of the graph, which may be desired as the output of a edge-label holdout.<br>The graph contains 2 edges with unknown edge type, which are edge between "- (degree 1 and weighted degree 1)" and "6 (degree 1 and weighted degree 1)" with unknown edge type and edge between "6 (degree 1 and weighted degree 1)" and "- (degree 1 and weighted degree 1)" with unknown edge type.<br>, making up 66.67 of the edges.<br>
