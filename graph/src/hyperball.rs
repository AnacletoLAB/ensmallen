    /// Computes a provided centrality of the graph using the HyperBall algorithm.
    ///
    /// This implementation of the HyperBall algorithm computes the provided centrality measure for the
    /// given graph. The algorithm iteratively computes the distances between nodes using a probabilistic
    /// data structure called HyperLogLog, which can approximate the number of distinct elements in a set
    /// with high accuracy while using little memory. The HyperBall algorithm updates each node's counter
    /// by taking the union of its neighbours' counters, and then computes the provided centrality measure
    /// based on the number of distinct elements in each node's counter. The algorithm repeats this process
    /// until each node's counter reaches a steady state, at which point the algorithm terminates.
    ///
    /// # Implementation Details on Work Stealing
    /// Work stealing is a technique used in parallel computing to distribute and balance
    /// the workload among a group of threads or processes. In a work-stealing system,
    /// each thread maintains its own deque of tasks, and when a thread finishes its own tasks,
    /// it may randomly or deterministically steal tasks from the deque of another thread in the system.
    ///
    /// The idea behind work stealing is to avoid load imbalance among the threads.
    /// Load imbalance can occur when one thread is assigned more work than others,
    /// causing it to be idle while the other threads are busy. Work stealing helps
    /// to mitigate this problem by allowing threads to share their workloads,
    /// ensuring that all threads stay busy and the overall performance of the system is maximized.
    /// Work stealing also improves cache utilization by keeping the data local to the thread that needs it,
    /// reducing the amount of cache invalidation and contention.
    ///
    /// Work stealing threads are commonly used in many programming frameworks,
    /// such as the Rayon library in Rust, to create parallel code that
    /// automatically balances the workload among threads.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    /// * `counters_ops` - A closure that takes four arguments: a mutable reference to a centrality score,
    ///   the current count of distinct elements in a node's counter, the previous count of distinct elements
    ///   in a node's counter, and the current iteration number. The closure is used to update each node's
    ///   centrality score based on its counter.
    ///
    /// # Type Parameters
    /// * `PRECISION` - The precision parameter for the HyperLogLog data structure. This determines the
    ///   accuracy of the distance approximations and the memory usage of the algorithm.
    /// * `BITS` - The number of bits used to store each element in the HyperLogLog data structure. This
    ///  determines the memory usage of the algorithm.
    ///
    /// # Constraints
    /// * `PRECISION` must be a compile-time constant.
    /// * `BITS` must be a compile-time constant.
    /// * `PRECISION` must be less than or equal to the maximum precision supported by the HyperLogLog
    ///   data structure. Values below 4 or higher than 16 are not supported.
    /// * BITS must be either 5 or 6 - other values are functionally possible but discouraged by
    /// empirical evidence.
