/// The "simplest" is to multiply the value for the right exponent:alloc

/// # use graph::random::random_u64;
/// let result: f64 = (random_u64() >> 11) as f64 * 2.0f64.powf(-53.0);

///
/// ```
/// # use graph::random::random_u64;
/// let v: u64 = (random_u64() >> 11) | (1023 << 52);
/// let r: f64 = unsafe{f64::from_le_bytes(v.to_le_bytes())};
/// let result: f64 = r - 1f64;
/// ```
/// the informations about the structure of a f64 was taken from [IEEE 754](https://standards.ieee.org/content/ieee-standards/en/standard/754-2019.html)
///
/// First we shift the value in order to fit the high-entropy values in the mantissa of the float.
///
/// Then we se the bits from 1 to 12 to 1023 so that we set the exponent to 1.
/// (Since the computed exponent is e - 1022 where e is the value we set)
///
/// Then we convert this u64 to a random f64 from 1 to 2.
///
/// The type punning is made with:
/// ```
/// # let v: u64 = 100;
/// let r: f64 = unsafe{f64::from_le_bytes(v.to_le_bytes())};
/// ```
/// The C equivalent is:
/// ```C
/// double r = *((double *)&v);
/// ```
///
/// The last step is to fix the range form 1 - 2, to 0 - 1.
///
/// As Vigna [says](http://prng.di.unimi.it/), these two methods should have equivalent performances on modern hardware.
/// But in our benchmarks we found the second (and more complicated) one to be slightly faster.
///
/// # Examples
/// ```
/// use graph::random::random_f64;
///
/// let frnd: f64 = random_f64();
/// assert!(0.0 <= frnd && frnd <= 1.0);
/// println!("The random value is: {}", frnd);
